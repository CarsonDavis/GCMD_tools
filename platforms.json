Taking into account the\ndifferent mission objectives, and attempting to satisfy them in a\nquasi-optimal way in the course of ERS-1's lifetime, has held to the\ndefinition of phases of activity during the mission:\n\n\n- Phase 0: Orbit acquisition, initial switch-on and\nfunctional check-out (2 weeks after the launch)\n- Phase A: The Commisioning phase, using a 3 day repeat\ncycle (25 July 1991-10 December 1991)\n- Phase B : The first ice phase, using a 3 day repeat cycle\n (28 December 1991-1 April 1992)\n- Phase R: The Roll-Tilt phase, using a 35 day repeat cycle\n (2 April 1992-14 April 1992)\n- Phase C: The first multi-disciplinary phase, using a 35\nday repeat cycle\n (14 April 1992-23 December 1993)\n- Phase D: The second ice phase, using a 3 day repeat cycle\n (23 December 1993-10 April 1994)\n- Phase E: The first geodetic phase, using a 172 day repeat\ncycle\n (10 April 1994-28 September 1994)\n- Phase F: The second Geodetic Phase, using a 172 day\nrepeat cycle\n (28 September 1994-21 March 1995)\n- Phase G: The second Multi-Disciplinary Phase, using a 35\nday repeat cycle\n (21 March 1995-10 March 2000)\n\nIn the first half of April 1992, the satellite was operated in a\nRoll-tilt-mode (RTM) to allow SAR imaging at a different view\nangle. In fact by rotating the satellite body around its velocity\nvector (so-called 'Roll-tilt mode') the angle at which all the\ninstruments look at the Earth can be varied. This allows\nexperimentation with the SAR at an incidence angle of 35 degrees\ninstead of the standard 23 degrees, thereby permitting analysis of a\ntotally different set of signatures from objects on the Earth's\nsurface, including in particular vegetation.\n\nRelated URL:\n\nThe ERS Missions: http://earth.esa.int/ers\n\nERS-1 Design: http://earth.esa.int/ers/satconc\n\nFor any query, please refer to:\n\nESA/ESRIN Earth Observation Help Desk\n\nhttp://earth.esa.int\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: ERS-1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: ERS Earth Resource Satellite\n      Short_Name: ERS-1\n      Long_Name: European Remote Sensing Satellite-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: ERS-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: ATSR\n      Short_Name: RA\n      Short_Name: SAR\n      Short_Name: AMI\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 782 to 785 km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 98.52 deg\n      Period: 100 min\n      Repeat_Cycle: 3-day, 35-day and 176-day\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-09-14\n   Online_Resource: http://earth.esa.int/ers/satconc/\n   Online_Resource: http://earth.esa.int/ers/\n   Online_Resource: http://www.astronautix.com/craft/ers12.htm\n   Sample_Image: http://earth.esa.int/icons/eeo/_ers-1_fully_deployed.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1991-07-17\n      Launch_Site: Kourou, French Guiana\n      Design_Life: 2-3 YRS\n      Primary_Sponsor: ESA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "MTSAT-2": {"short_name": "MTSAT-2", "long_name": "The Multi-functional Transport Satellite 2"}, "CBERS-1": {"short_name": "CBERS-1", "long_name": "China-Brazil Earth Resource Satellite 1", "description": "[Source: INPE CBERS home page, \nhttp://www.cbers.inpe.br/ingles/ ] \n\nThe first satellite to be developed, CBERS-1, was launched with great success by the Chinese Long March 4B launcher, from the Taiyuan Launch Base, on Oct. 14, 1999.

The manufacturer evaluated a number of different configurations before finally deciding on a high wing twin Rolls-Royce Dart engine layout with a pressurised cabin for 28 passengers.\n\nThe first prototype, registered PH-NIV, first flew on 24 November 1955. The second prototype and initial production machines were 3 ft (0.9 m) longer, addressing the first aircraft's slightly tail-heavy handling and also providing space for more (32) passengers. These aircraft also used the more powerful Dart Mk 528 engine. The first production model, the F27-100, was delivered to Aer Lingus in September 1958.\n\nIn 1956 Fokker signed a licensing deal with the US aircraft manufacturer Fairchild for the latter to construct the F27 in the USA. The first U.S.-built aircraft flew on 12 April 1958. Fairchild also independently developed a stretched version, called the FH-227.\n\nAt the end of the Fokker F27s production in 1987, 793 units had been built (including 207 in the USA by Fairchild), which makes it the most successful western European civil turboprop airliner.\n\nMany aircraft have been modified from passenger service to cargo or express-package freighter roles.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Fokker developed a successor to the Friendship, the Fokker 50. Although based on the F27-500 airframe, the Fokker 50 is virtually a new aircraft with Pratt & Whitney Canada engines and modern systems. Its general performance and passenger comfort were improved over the F27.\n\n[Text provided by: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fokker_F27 ]\n\n[Photo provided by: http://www.zap16.com/ ]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: FOKKER F27\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Aircraft\n      Short_Name: FOKKER F27\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-14\n   Online_Resource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fokker_F27\n   Sample_Image: http://www.zap16.com/images/maac_f27_cf-jsd.jpg\nEnd_Group"}, "GEOSAT": {"short_name": "GEOSAT"}, "Swarm-A": {"short_name": "Swarm-A", "description": "Swarm is the fifth Earth Explorer mission approved in ESA's Living Planet Programme, and was successfully launched on 22 November 2013.\n\nAs part of the Third Party Missions programme, the e-POP instrument of the Canadian Space Agency's CASSIOPE mission joined the constellation in February 2018.\n\nThe research objectives of the Swarm mission is to provide the best-ever survey of the geomagnetic field and its temporal evolution as well as the electric field in the atmosphere using a constellation of 3 identical satellites carrying sophisticated magnetometers and electric field instruments."}, "BEIJING-1": {"short_name": "BEIJING-1", "description": "SSTL has developed the BEIJING-1 microsatellite bus for the Beijing Landview Mapping Information Technology Ltd (BLMIT).

This program, previously known as DAPP (Data Acquisition and Processing Program), was classified until March 1973. The objectives of this program were to provide global visual and infrared cloudcover data and specialized environmental data to support Department of Defense requirements. Operationally, the program consisted of two satellites in sun-synchronous polar orbits, with the ascending node of one satellite in early morning and the other at local noon. The 5.4-m-long spacecraft was separated into four sections: (1) a precision mounting platform (PMP) for sensors and equipment requiring precise alignment; (2) an equipment support module (ESM) containing the electronics, reaction wheels, and some meteorological sensors; (3) a reaction control equipment (RCE) support structure (including the third-stage motor and hydrazine reaction control system); and (4) a 9.29-sq-m solar cell panel. The spacecraft stabilization was controlled by a combination flywheel and magnetic control coil system so sensors could be maintained in the desired \"earth-looking\" mode. One feature was the precision-pointing accuracy of the primary imager to 0.01 deg provided by a star sensor and an updated ephemeris navigation system. This allowed automatic geographical mapping of the digital imagery to the nearest picture element. The operational linescan system (OLS), built by Westinghouse, was the primary data acquisition system that provided real-time or stored, multi-orbit, day-and-night visual and infrared imagery of clouds, and provided with the data calibration, timing, and other auxiliary signals to the spacecraft for digital transmission to the ground. A supplementary meterological sensor, the special sensor H (SSH), a step-scanning radiometer, was the infrared temperature-humidity-ozone sounder. Either recorded or real-time data were transmitted to ground-receiving sites by two redundant S-band transmitters. Recorded data were read out to tracking sites located at Fairchild AFB, Wash., and Loring AFB, Maine, and relayed by SATCOM to Air Force Global Weather Central, Offutt AFB, Nebraska. Real-time data were read out at mobile tactical sites located around the world. A more complete description of the satellite can be found in the report, D. A.

A box-beam structure mounted within the center of the torus\nprovided support for the larger sensor experiments.  Mounted on the\ncontrol housing unit, which was located on top of the spacecraft, were\nsun sensors, horizon scanners, and a command antenna.  The spacecraft\nspin axis was pointed at the earth.  An advanced attitude-control\nsystem permitted the spacecraft's orientation to be controlled to\nwithin plus or minus 1 deg in all three axes (pitch, roll, and yaw).\nEight experiments were selected: (1) Limb Infrared Monitoring of the\nStratosphere (LIMS), (2) Stratospheric And Mesopheric Sounder (SAMS),\n(3) Coastal-Zone Color Scanner (CZCS), (4) Stratospheric Aerosol\nMeasurement II (SAM II), (5) Earth Radiation Budget (ERB), (6)\nScanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), (7) Solar\nBackscatter UV and Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (SBUV/TOMS), and\n(8) Temperature-Humidity Infrared Radiometer (THIR).

The repetivity of LISS - III is 24 days.\n\nWiFS camera collects data in two spectral bands with a spatial resolution of 188m and a ground swath of 810 km. By virtue of its wide swath there is huge side lap between adjacent paths. A repetivity of 3 days can be achieved by suitably combining paths.\n\nThe satellite is equipped with an On Board Tape Recorder (OBTR) with a capacity of 62 Gb, for collecting data outside the visibility region of any ground station.

This program, previously known as DAPP (Data Acquisition and Processing Program), was classified until March 1973. The objective of this program is to provide global visual and infrared cloudcover data and specialized environmental data to support Department of Defense operational weather analysis and forecasting requirements. Operationally, the program consists of two satellites in sun-synchronous polar orbits, with the ascending node of one satellite in early morning and the other at local noon. The 6.4-m-long spacecraft is separated into four sections: (1) a precision mounting platform for sensors and equipment requiring precise alignment; (2) an equipment support module containing the electronics, reaction wheels, and some meteorological sensors; (3) a reaction control equipment support structure containing the third-stage rocket motor and supporting the ascent phase reaction control equipment; and (4) a 9.29-sq-m solar cell panel. The spacecraft stabilization is controlled by a combination flywheel and magnetic control coil system so that sensors are maintained in the desired earth-looking mode. One feature is the precision-pointing accuracy of the primary imager to 0.01 deg provided by a star sensor and an updated ephemeris navigation system. This allows automatic geographical mapping of the digital imagery to the nearest picture element. The operational linescan system is the primary data acquisition system that provides real-time or stored, multi-orbit, day-and-night, visual and infrared imagery of clouds. A supplementary sensor package contains five special sensors: (1) a microwave temperature sounder, (2) an X-ray spectrometer, (3) an ionospheric/scintillation monitor, (4) a precipitating electron/ion spectrometer, and (5) a microwave imager. Either recorded or real-time data are transmitted to ground-receiving sites by two redundant S-band transmitters. Recorded data are read out to tracking sites located at Fairchild AFB, Washington, and at Loring AFB, Maine, and relayed by SATCOM to Air Force Global Weather Central, Offutt AFB, Nebraska. Real-time data are read out at mobile tactical sites located around the world. Additional information concerning this satellite can be found in the report by D. A.

The sounder used\ntwo dipole antennas (73 and 18.7 m long). The satellite was spin-stabilized at\nabout 2.9 rpm after antenna deployment. Some control was exercised over the\nspin rate and attitude by using magnetically induced torques to change the spin\nrate and to precess the spin axis. A tape recorder with 1-h capacity was\nincluded on the satellite. The satellite could be programmed to take recorded\nobservations for four different time periods for each full recording period.\nThe recorder data were dumped only at Ottawa. For non-tape-recorded\nobservations, data for the satellite and subsatellite regions could be acquired\nand telemetered when the spacecraft was in the line of sight of telemetry\nstations. The selected telemetry stations were in areas that provided primary\ndata coverage near the 80-deg-W meridian and in areas near Hawaii, Singapore,\nAustralia, England, Norway, India, Japan, Antarctica, New Zealand, and Central\nAfrica.

The spacecraft was also designed and developed by KhSC of Moscow.\n\nThe Monitor-E mission represents the first operational use of the newly developed modular and multipurpose Yakhta platform, intended for use in various remote sensing, communications, and space research applications.\n\nSpacecraft:\n\nThe spacecraft is 3-axis stabilized using the generic Yakhta platform with a launch mass of 750 kg. The attitude pointing accuracy is 0.1\u00ba, the attitude rate control accuracy is 0.001\u00ba/s (angular drift). Power of 1200 W (max at EOL) is provided by two solar panels. The spacecraft features a cross-track pointing capability of \u00b130\u00ba from nadir by using a flywheel system, thereby providing a FOR (Field of Regard) for observation coverage considerably beyond that of the nominal swath width. This new S/C agility is provided by the introduction of a CMG (Control Moment Gyro) subsystem, an actuator within the ADCS (Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem), developed by Russian industry. KhSC refers to the ADCS as ICS (Integrated Control System). The S/C system design life is 5 years.\n\nNote: The Monitor-E spacecraft is of Monitor-E heritage (same name of previous and current missions) which was launched on June 30, 2003 from Plesetsk on a Rockot KS vehicle. On this flight, Monitor-E functioned as a mock-up (or prototype) spacecraft of KhSC with a mass of 700 kg. The spacecraft Monitor-E remained attached to the upper stage of the launch vehicle, it was used for demonstration purposes. \n\nRF communications: The payload data are being received in X-band by ground stations of federal, regional, and local levels in Russia. An effort is being made to acquire the data in near real-time in support of fast reaction response applications.\n\nOrbit: Sun-synchronous near-circular orbit: mean altitude = 540 km, inclination = 97.5\u00ba.\n\nLaunch: A launch of Monitor-E took place on Aug. 26, 2005 on a Rockot Breeze-KM launch vehicle of Eurockot Launch Services from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia.\n\nMission status: Monitor-E is operational as of 2007. So far, the spacecraft has collected imagery of more than 80 million km2.\n\n\u2022 After launch and orbit insertion, the spacecraft experienced initial attitude control problems (flight controllers lost contact with the satellite). However, the flight controllers have regained control of Monitor-E, all systems are operating nominally and the spacecraft is in the commissioning phase as of early November 2005 (the checkout phase is estimated to last for up to 6 months to test the new components of the platform and the payload - and to conduct various operational experiments).\n\n\u2022 In Sept. 2006, Monitor-E experienced a malfunction of its ADCS (Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem).

The overall objective is to provide scene-specific spot imagery in high resolution to the Indian Armed Forces - which is in the process of establishing an Aerospace Command.\n\nThe spacecraft and its payload, built by ISRO, is practically an identical copy of the CartoSat-2 spacecraft of ISRO. It features a lightweight and compact bus structure using the BMU (Bus Management Unit) for integrated bus functions (of the AOCS, TT&C, etc.). The spacecraft is 3-axis stabilized using high torque reaction wheels, magnetic torquers, and hydrazine thrusters. Attitude sensing is provided by a high performance star sensor and by an improved IRU (Inertial Reference Unit). The satellite is very agile providing a body-pointing capability in along-track and cross-track of up to \u00b145\u00ba (this supports a revisit capability of certain target regions within 4 days). Also use of the SPS (Satellite Positioning System), an 8-channel GPS receiver (C/A code) on-board for the provision of instantaneous state vectors (state vector using pseudo range and range rate measurements) for the spacecraft.\n\nThe fixed solar arrays (triple-junction solar cells) provide a power of 900 W when pointed toward the sun; two NiCd batteries of 18 Ah capacity are being used for ecliptic phase bridging.\n\nCartoSat-2A has a launch mass of 690 kg and a design life of 5 years. \n\nLaunch: The launch of CartoSat-2A took place on April 28, 2008 on a PSLV launcher. The launch was conducted from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) SHAR, Sriharikota space station in southern India. Next to the primary payload of CartoSat-2A, the PSLV-C9 vehicle successfully launched the IMS-1 (Indian Microsatellite-1) of 83 kg and eight nanosatellites for international customers.\n\nSensor complement:\n\nPAN Camera (Panchromatic Camera). The objective is to provide imagery for cartographic applications. The optical system is designed with two mirror Ritchey-Chretien on-axis obscured reflective telescope system with a concave hyperboloidal primary mirror and convex hyperboloid secondary mirrors and the field correcting relay optics. The mirrors are made of special Zerodur glass and are light-weighted to about 60% as in CartoSat-1 series. The mirrors are mounted inside the telescope cylinder made of CFRP with special MFDs (Mirror Fixation Devices) and the whole telescope assembly is mounted to the spacecraft structure through a special suspension arrangement.

This highly successful spacecraft has helped scientists answer\nfundamental questions about the causes and makeup of the aurora. \n\nFAST was launched on August 21, 1996 from a Pegasus rocket into a highly\nelliptical orbit. It crosses Earth's auroral zones (donut shaped regions\ncentered on the poles) four times each orbit, and only collects high-resolution\ndata (\"snapshots\") while in those zones. It ventures high into the charged\nparticle environment of the aurora to measure the electric and magnetic fields,\nplasma waves, energetic electrons and ions, ion mass composition, and thermal\nplasma density and temperature.\n\nThe FAST instrument set consists of sixteen electrostatic analyzers, four\nelectric field langmuir probes suspended on 30 m wire booms, two electric field\nlangmuir probes on 3 m extendible booms, searchcoil and fluxgate magnetometers\nand a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The science investigation makes\nextremely temporal and spatial resolution measurements of the auroral plasma at\napogee altitude. The instrument hardware consists of the sensor assemblies and\nan instrument data processor. The instrument electronics include a 32-bit data\nprocessing unit that performs the science data processing and recording in a\none gigabit, solid-state memory. The stored data are transferred to the ground\nat one of three selectable high data rates of 900 Kbps, 1.5 Mbps or 2.25 Mbps.\nThe instruments weigh 51 kg; the total observatory mass is 191 kg. The FAST\nmission is in a 351 x 4175 km orbit with an 83? inclination.\n\nThe FAST observatory is a 12 rpm, spin-stabilized spacecraft with its spin axis\noriented parallel to the orbit axis. Spin rate and spin-axis orientation are\nmaintained by two magnetic torquer coils, one spinning Sun sensor, one horizon\ncrossing indicator and a spacecraft magnetometer. The Attitude Control System\n(ACS) provides closed-loop spin-rate control. Spin-axis precession is performed\nopen loop and is closed via ground commands. After computation on the ground,\nattitude knowledge is accurate to within one degree.\n\nThe body-mounted solar array contains 5.6 m2 of solar cells that can distribute\n52 W of orbit average power to the spacecraft and instruments. The orbit\naverage power consumption of the spacecraft hardware is 33 W. The instruments\nconsume 19 W orbit average power, 39 W when operating. Instruments are\nfrequently powered off in order to maintain a positive energy balance.\n\nThe data system for the FAST mission consists of dual 8085, 8-bit spacecraft\ncomputers. The spacecraft computers perform health and safety functions, power\ndistribution, data encoding/decoding and launch vehicle interface. A\nmulti-element micropatch antenna mounted on a boom above the spacecraft\nsupports ground communications. Commands are uplinked at 2 Kbps. Health and\nsafety data is telemetered to the ground at 4 Kbps. A Transportable Orbital\nTracking Station (TOTS) was placed in Alaska to collect real-time science\ntelemetry while the spacecraft is passing through the northern aurora. TOTS is\nhighly automated and portable; it has an 8 m antenna with 200 W of uplink power\nand can be packed for shipment in three ISO containers.\n \nThe FAST instruments consist of:\nElectric Field Experiment: The electric field experiment is composed of three\northogonal boom pairs. Spherical sensors deployed on radial wire and axial\nstacer booms will provide information on the plasma density and electron\ntemperature.\n\nMagnetic Field Experiment: The magnetic field experiment consists of two\nmagnetometers mounted 180? apart on deployable graphite epoxy booms. The search\ncoil magnetometer uses a three-axis sensor system to provide magnetic field\ndata over the frequency range of 10 Hz to 2.5 kHz. The flux gate magnetometer\nis a three-axis system using high, stable, low noise, ring core sensors to\nprovide magnetic field information for DC to 100 Hz.\n\nTime-of-Flight Energy Angle Mass Spectrograph (TEAMS): The TEAMS instrument is\na high sensitivity, mass-resolving spectrometer that measures full\nthree-dimension distribution functions of the major ion species with one spin\nof the spacecraft. The TEAMS experiment covers the core of all plasma\ndistributions of importance in the auroral region.\n\nElectrostatic Analyzers (ESA): Sixteen ESAs configured in four stacks will be\nused for both electron and ion measurements. The four stacks are placed around\nthe spacecraft such that the entire package is provided a full 360? field of\nview. The ESAs can provide a 64-step energy sweep, covering approximately 3 eV\nto 30 KeV up to 16 times per second.\n\nFor more information, see:\nhttp://sprg.ssl.berkeley.edu/fast/\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: FAST\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Solar/Space Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: FAST\n      Long_Name: Fast Auroral Snapshot Explorer\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: Explorer 70\n      Short_Name: SMEX/FAST\n      Short_Name: Small Explorer/FAST\n      Short_Name: 24285\n      Short_Name: 1996-049A\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: MFS/FAST\n      Short_Name: EFS/FAST\n      Short_Name: ESA/FAST\n      Short_Name: TEAMS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Inclination: 83 degrees\n      Period: 133 m\n      Perigee: 350 km\n      Apogee: 4175 km\n      Orbit_Type: HEO > Highly Elliptical Orbit\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://sprg.ssl.berkeley.edu/fast/intro.html\n   Sample_Image: http://sprg.ssl.berkeley.edu/fast/graphics/fast.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1996-08-21\n      Launch_Site: Vandenberg Air Force Base, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "NAVSTAR": {"short_name": "NAVSTAR"}, "CMORPH": {"short_name": "CMORPH", "description": "CMORPH (CPC MORPHing technique) produces global precipitation analyses at very high spatial and temporal resolution.

The SRL-1 consists of two elements: a suite of radar instruments called the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) jointly developed by NASA and DARA of Germany and ASI of Italy, and the Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellite (MAPS) instrument to measure atmospheric air pollution. SRL-1 is the first in a series of flights of this payload designed to (1) acquire radar imagery of the Earth's surface for studies in geology, geography, hydrology, oceanography, agronomy, and botany; (2) gather data for future space-borne radar systems;  and (3) provide measurements of the global distribution of carbon monoxide (CO) in the troposphere. Instruments on board include the Shuttle Imaging Radar-C (SIR-C) with multi-frequency (C- and  L-Bands), multi-polarization (HH, VV, HV, VH), and multi-incidence angle (15 to 55  degrees) capabilities thus lending itself to a wide range of earth surface applications; the X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (X-SAR), an X-band, VV-polarized imaging radar system, built by Dornier (Germany) and Alenia (Italy) for the German Space Agency (DARA)/German Aerospace Research Establishment (DLR) and the Italian Space Agency (ASI); and, the Mapping Air Pollution from Space (MAPS) instrument for the study of global air pollution. The MAPS instrument, from NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth (MtPE) Program.  Four 45-Mbps data channels were recorded on special high data rate tape recorders and real-time data was transmitted to ground stations. About 50 hours each of SIR-C and X-SAR data were recorded during the mission. The combined SIR-C/X-SAR Science Team was made up of 49 members and 3 associates representing 13 countries. SIR-C/X-SAR data collection was focused on several worldwide supersites and correlated with ground and aircraft measurements. Radar data was also calibrated to allow comparisons with other operating spaceborne radars (ERS-1 SAR, JERS-1 SAR).\n\nBoth SIR-C and X-SAR will use on-board tape recorders to store data as well as limited real-time transmissions to the ground. Each radar has its own on-board data handling system and each radar can have its data routed through the TDRSS for real-time transmission (Ku-band). SIR-C data are recorded in parallel and X-SAR data is recorded serially. SIR-C and X-SAR data will be preprocessed at the Payload Operations Control Center (POCC) at NASA/JSC before delivery to JPL and operations centers in Germany and Italy. Commands are sent to the SRL-1 from POCC. At mission end, data tapes recorded on-board are sent to the PI sites.\n\nThe SIR-C/X-SAR part of the SRL-1 mission is expected to collect over 50 hours of data, both recorded and real-time. Real-time raw data will be pre-processed by the instrument PIs and science teams and stored at the PI sites at JPL, in Germany, and in Italy for analysis. SIR-C data will be processed at JPL using the JPL advanced digital SAR processor, leading to processed SAR images on 8-mm digital tape and on film. Plans include the production of CD-ROMs with 100 m resolution images. X-SAR data will be pre-processed within 3 months. Image products will be made available to X-SAR investigators. Both Germany and Italy will operate separate archives and processing facilities for X-SAR data. SIR-C processed data will eventually be be archived with the EOSDIS DAAC at EROS Data Center. All processed MAPS data is expected to be archived with the EOSDIS DAAC at NASA/Langley. Two additional flights of SRL are planned (August 1994 and 1995).\n\nSome SIR-C and X-SAR images are publically available on the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) FTP site: jplinfo.jpl.nasa.gov in the directory /sircxsar. The images are also available through the World Wide Web (WWW) at http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/.

The cylindrically shaped spacecraft measured 190.5 cm in diameter and 230 cm in length, exclusive of a magnetometer that extended an additional 83 cm beyond the cylinder shell. The primary structural members were a honeycombed equipment shelf and thrust tube. The VISSR telescope was mounted on the equipment shelf and viewed the Earth through a special aperture in the side of the spacecraft.  A support structure extended radially out from the thrust tube and was affixed to the solar panels, which formed the outer walls of the spacecraft and provided the primary source of electrical power.  Located in the annulus-shaped space between the thrust tube and the solar panels were stationkeeping and dynamics control equipment, batteries, and most of the SEM equipment.  Proper spacecraft attitude and spin rate (approximately 100 rpm) were maintained by two separate sets of jet thrusters mounted around the spacecraft equator and activated by ground command.  The spacecraft used both UHF-band and S-band frequencies in its telemetry and command subsystem.  A low-power VHF transponder provided telemetry and command during launch and then served as a backup for the primary subsystem once the spacecraft attained orbit.\n\nThe spin-stabilized spacecraft carried a visible infrared spin-scan radiometer atmospheric sounder, meteorological data collection and transmission system, space environment monitor, and a biaxial fluxgate magnetometer.  It operated at at 75 degrees West as GOES-EAST, but on July 30, 1984, GOES 5 VAS experienced a failure, thus NOAA had to relocate GOES 6 to a more central 98 degrees West position, and to reactivate GOES 1 and GOES 4 for the acquisition and relay of VISSR information, respectively, from the western U.S. \n\nFor more information on GOES satellites:\nhttp://www.oso.noaa.gov/goes/\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: GOES-5\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite)\n      Short_Name: GOES-5\n      Long_Name: Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 5\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: GOES E\n      Short_Name: 12472\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: SXM\n      Short_Name: VAS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Type: GEO > Geosynchronous > Geostationary\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-10-04\n   Online_Resource: http://www.oso.noaa.gov/goes/\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1981-049A\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1981-05-22\n      Launch_Site: CAPE CANAVERAL/KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NOAA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "AIRBOAT": {"short_name": "AIRBOAT"}, "C/NOFS": {"short_name": "C/NOFS", "long_name": "Communication and Navigation Outage Forecast System", "description": "The Communications/Navigation Outage Forecasting System (C/NOFS) is a prototype operational system designed to monitor and forecast ionospheric scintillation in real-time and on a global scale.

The hyperspectral instrument is the first of its kind to provide images of land-surface in more than 220 spectral colors. The Hyperion will demonstrate the ability to perform detailed spectral mapping with high radiometric accuracy. In the future, an operational version of the Hyperion will allow complex land ecosystems to be imaged and accurately classified. The Advanced Land Imager (ALI) instrument yields almost four times better performance at only one-fourth the cost and weight of the Landsat ETM+. Finally the Linear Etalon Imaging Spectral Array/Atmospheric Corrector (LEISA/AC) is an infrared camera, which can be used to remove the effects of the atmosphere from surface pictures obtained by instruments such as the ALI on EO-1 and Landsat. This instrument will provide scientific return both in terms of improved imagery and hyperspectral sensing capabilities. It will also test a number of new technologies. Because the AC is small and adaptable to different spacecraft configurations, it is a bolt-on instrument, which can be attached to any future Earth imaging spacecraft. The three advanced imaging instruments will lead to a new generation of lighter weight, higher performance and lower cost Landsat-type Earth surface imaging instruments.\n\nKey EO-1 Facts:\nOrbit\nType: Sun-synchronous\nEquatorial Crossing: 10:01 a.m.\nAltitude: 705 km\nInclination: 98.2\u00b0\nPeriod: 98.8 minutes\nRepeat Cycle: 16 days\nDimensions: 2 m height \u00d7 2.5 m diameter\nMass: 529 kg\nPower: 300 W\nDesign Life: 18 months; EO-1 is well beyond its planned mission life and is\nstill functioning\nDownlink: X-Band (105 Mbps), Sioux Falls, Svalbard, Alaska, Hobart (Australia)\nNote: Part of the Morning Constellation of satellites, lags one minute behind\nLandsat 7\nContributors\nALI: MIT/Lincoln Laboratory, NASA GSFC\nHyperion: TRW, NASA GSFC\nLAC: NASA GSFC Applied Engineering and Technology Directorate (AETD)\n\n[Summary provided by NASA]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: EO-1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: EO-1\n      Long_Name: Earth Observing 1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: New Millennium Program Earth Observing-1 (NMP EO-1)\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: LAC\n      Short_Name: ALI\n      Short_Name: HYPERION\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 705 km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 98.2\u00b0\n      Equator_Crossing: 10:01 a.m.\n      Period: 98.8 minutes\n      Repeat_Cycle: 16 days\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-02-06\n   Online_Resource: http://eo1.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n   Online_Resource: http://nmp.jpl.nasa.gov/\n   Online_Resource: http://nasascience.nasa.gov/missions/eo-1\n   Sample_Image: http://www.spaceandtech.com/spacedata/logs/2000/2000-075a_eo1_image.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2000-11-21\n      Launch_Site: Vandenberg Air Force Base, California\n      Design_Life: 18 months\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "NOAA-10": {"short_name": "NOAA-10", "long_name": "National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration-10", "description": "NOAA-10 (ATN series) was launched on September 17, 1986 and is a\nthird-generation operational meteorological satellite.

The spacecraft weight was 403 kg. Power was supplied by a solar cell array, which charged two 6-ampere-hour nickel-cadmium batteries. The spacecraft was three-axis stabilized with the yaw axis aligned toward the center of the earth to within 1 deg. The spin axis was normal to the orbit plane within 1 deg with a spin rate of one revolution per orbit. A single-axis scan platform was included in order to mount the low-altitude plasma instrument (81-070B-08). The platform rotated about the spin axis. A pulse code modulation telemetry data system was used that operated in real time or in a tape-recorder mode. Data were acquired on a science-problem-oriented basis, with closely coordinated operations of the various instruments, both satellites, and supportive experiments. Measurements were temporarily stored on tape recorders before transmission at an 8:1 playback-to-record ratio. Since commands were also stored in a command memory unit, spacecraft operations were not real time. \n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: DE-2\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: DE (Dynamics Explorer)\n      Short_Name: DE-2\n      Long_Name: Dynamics Explorer-2\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: DE 2\n      Short_Name: DE-B\n      Short_Name: Dynamics Explorer-B\n      Short_Name: Explorer 63\n      Short_Name: 12625\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: RPA\n      Short_Name: VECTOR MAGNETOGRAPHS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Period: 98 min.\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-09-12\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/database/MasterCatalog?sc=1981-070Bdata.html\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1981-08-03\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "BT-67": {"short_name": "BT-67", "long_name": "Basler BT-67", "description": "The BT-67 is a world-class transport aircraft with an impressive resume of performance.

Each Voyager had as its major objectives at each planet to: (1) investigate the circulation, dynamics, structure, and composition of the planet's atmosphere; (2) characterize the morphology, geology, and physical state of the satellites of the planet; (3) provide improved values for the mass, size, and shape of the planet, its satellites, and any rings; and, (4) determine the magnetic field structure and characterize the composition and distribution of energetic trapped particles and plasma therein.\n\nOriginally planned as a Grand Tour of the outer planets, including dual launches to Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto in 1976-77 and dual launches to Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune in 1979, budgetary constraints caused a dramatic rescoping of the project to two spacecraft, each of which would go to only Jupiter and Saturn. The new mission was called Mariner Jupiter/Saturn, or MJS. It was subsequently renamed Voyager about six months prior to launch. The rescoped mission was estimated to cost $250 million (through the end of Saturn operations), only a third of what the Grand Tour design would have cost.\n\nOriginally scheduled to launch twelve days after Voyager 2, Voyager 1's launch was delayed twice to prevent the occurrence of problems which Voyager 2 experienced after launch. Voyager 1's launch finally happened on 05 Sept. 1977 and was termed \"flawless and accurate\".\n\nAlthough launched sixteen days after Voyager 2, Voyager 1's trajectory was the quicker one to Jupiter. On 15 Dec. 1977, while both spacecraft were in the asteroid belt, Voyager 1 surpassed Voyager 2's distance from the Sun. Voyager 1 then proceeded to Jupiter (making its closest approach on 05 March 1979) and Saturn (with closest approach on 12 Nov. 1980). Both prior to and after planetary encounters observations were made of the interplanetary medium. Some 18,000 images of Jupiter and its satellites were taken by Voyager 1. In addition, roughly 16,000 images of Saturn, its rings and satellites were obtained.\n\nAfter its encounter with Saturn, Voyager 1 remained relatively quiescent, continuing to make in situ observations of the interplanetary environment and UV observations of stars. After nearly nine years of dormancy, Voyager 1's cameras were once again turned on to take a series of pictures. On 14 Feb. 1990, Voyager 1 looked back from whence it came and took the first \"family portrait\" of the solar system, a mosaic of 60 frames of the Sun and six of the planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) as seen from \"outside\" the solar system. After this final look back, the cameras on Voyager 1 were once again turned off. \n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: VOYAGER 1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Interplanetary Spacecraft\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: FLYBY\n      Short_Name: VOYAGER 1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: Mariner Jupiter/Saturn A\n      Short_Name: 10321\n      Short_Name: 1977-084A\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-03-06\n   Online_Resource: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/voyager/index.html\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/database/MasterCatalog?sc=1977-084A\n   Sample_Image: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/image/spacecraft/voyager.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1977-09-05\n      Launch_Site: Cape Canaveral/Kennedy Space Center, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "FLYBY": {"short_name": "FLYBY"}, "DMSP (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program)": {"short_name": "DMSP (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program)"}, "GEOSTAR": {"short_name": "GEOSTAR", "long_name": "GEophysical and Oceanographic STation for Abyssal Research", "description": "GEophysical and Oceanographic STation for Abyssal Research.\nThe Observatory (also named \"Bottom Station\") is a four-leg marine aluminium frame (overall dimension 3.50m x 3.50m x 3.30m) supporting all equipment and vessels constituting the scientific and operative payload.\nIn the design of the station particular care is paid to ensure correct installation and positioning of the various sensors, taking into account their specific requirements and sensitivity to interferences, induced noise, correct alignment, etc.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: GEOSTAR\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: In Situ Ocean-based Platforms\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: OCEAN PLATFORM/OCEAN STATIONS\n      Short_Name: GEOSTAR\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: GEophysical and Oceanographic STation for Abyssal Research\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2010-11-23\n   Online_Resource: http://roma2.rm.ingv.it/en/facilities/seafloor_multidisciplinary_observatories/1/geostar\n   Sample_Image: http://roma2.rm.ingv.it/userfiles/image/risorse/OsservatoriSottomarini/GEOSTAR.jpg\nEnd_Group"}, "Swarm": {"short_name": "Swarm"}, "IRS-P5": {"short_name": "IRS-P5", "long_name": "Indian Remote Sensing Satellite-P5 (CARTOSAT-1)", "description": "The CARTOSAT-1 (IRS-P5) is envisaged as a mission to meet the stereo data requirements of the user community.

The objective of the HCMM was to\nprovide comprehensive, accurate, high-spatial-resolution thermal surveys of the\nsurface of the earth.  The HCMM spacecraft was made of two distinct modules:\n(1) an instrument module, containing the heat capacity mapping radiometer and\nits supporting gear, and (2) a base module, containing the data handling,\npower, communications, command, and attitude control subsystems required to\nsupport the instrument module.  The spacecraft was spin stabilized at a rate of\n14 rpm.\nThe HCMM circular sun-synchronous orbit allowed the spacecraft to sense surface\ntemperatures near the maximum and minimum of the diurnal cycle.  The orbit had\na daylight ascending node with nominal equatorial crossing time of 2:00 p.m.\nSince there was no inclination adjustment capacity, the spacecraft drifted from\nthis crossing time by about 1 hour earlier per year.  There was no on-board\ndata storage capability, so only real-time data were transmitted when the\nsatellite came within reception range of seven ground stations.  The repeat\ncycle of the spacecraft was 16 days.  Day/night coverage over a given area\nbetween the latitudes of 85 deg N and 85 deg S occurred at intervals ranging\nfrom 12 to 36 h (once every 16 days).\nDuring February  21-23, 1980, the HCMM orbital altitude was lowered from 620 km\nto 540 km to stop the drift of the orbit plane to unfavorable sun angles which\nin turn reduced the power collection capability of the solar panels.

The Venera 13 mission consisted of a bus (81-106A)\nand an attached descent craft (81-106D). The Venera 13 descent\ncraft/lander was a hermetically sealed pressure vessel, which\ncontained most of the instrumentation and electronics, mounted\non a ring-shaped landing platform and topped by an antenna. The\ndesign was similar to the earlier Venera 9-12 landers. It\ncarried instruments to take chemical and isotopic measurements,\nmonitor the spectrum of scattered sunlight, and record electric\ndischarges during its descent phase through the Venusian\natmosphere. The spacecraft utilized a camera system, an X-ray\nfluorescence spectrometer, a screw drill and surface sampler, a\ndynamic penetrometer, and a seismometer to conduct\ninvestigations on the surface.  After launch and a four month\ncruise to Venus, the descent vehicle separated from the bus and\nplunged into the Venus atmosphere on 1 March 1982. After\nentering the atmosphere a parachute was deployed. At an altitude\nof 47 km the parachute was released and simple airbraking was\nused the rest of the way to the surface. Venera 13 landed about\n950 km northeast of Venera 14 at 7 deg 30 min S, 303 E, just\neast of the eastern extension of an elevated region known as\nPhoebe Regio. The area was composed of bedrock outcrops\nsurrounded by dark, fine-grained soil. After landing an imaging\npanorama was started and a mechanical drilling arm reached to\nthe surface and obtained a sample, which was deposited in a\nhermetically sealed chamber, maintained at 30 degrees C and a\npressure of about .05 atmospheres. The composition of the sample\ndetermined by the X-ray flourescence spectrometer put it in the\nclass of weakly differentiated melanocratic alkaline\ngabbroids. The lander survived for 127 !  minutes (the planned\ndesign life was 32 minutes) in an environment with a temperature\nof 457 degrees C and a pressure of 84 Earth atmospheres.

GOES-9, which is currently partially operational, is being provided to the Japanese Meteorological Agency to replace their failing geostationary satellite.  GOES I-M represents the next generation of meteorological satellites and introduces two new features.  The first feature, flexible scan, offers small-scale area imaging that lets meteorologists take pictures of local weather trouble spots. This allows them to improve short-term forecasts over local areas. The second feature, simultaneous and independent imaging and sounding, is designed to allow weather forecasters to use multiple measurements of weather phenomena to increase the accuracy of their forecasts.  Each satellite in the series carries two major instruments: an Imager and a Sounder. These instruments acquire high resolution visible and infrared data, as well as temperature and moisture profiles of the atmosphere. They continuously transmit these data to ground terminals where the data are processed for rebroadcast to primary weather services both in the United States and around the world, including the global research community.  The GOES I-M mission is scheduled to run from the mid-1990s into the first decade of the 21st century.  Each element of the mission has been designed to meet all in-orbit performance requirements for at least five years. The GOES I-M system performs the following basic functions: + Acquisition, processing, and dissemination of imaging and sounding data. + Acquisition and dissemination of Space Environment Monitor (SEM) data. + Reception and relay of data from ground-based Data Collection Platforms (DCPs) that are situated in carefully selected urban and remote areas to the NOAA Command and Data Acquisition (CDA) station. + Continuous relay of Weather Facsimile (WEFAX) and other data to users, independent of all other functions. + Relay of distress signals from people, aircraft, or marine vessels to the search and rescue ground stations of the Search and Rescue Satellite Aided Tracking (SARSAT) system. GOES provides the instantaneous relay functions for the SARSAT system. A dedicated search and rescue transponder on board GOES is designed to detect emergency distress signals originating from Earth-based sources. These unique identification signals are normally combined with signals received by a low-Earth orbiting satellite system and relayed to a search and rescue ground terminal. The combined data are used to perform effective search and rescue operations. The GOES I-M system serves a region covering the central and eastern Pacific Ocean; North, Central, and South America; and the central and western Atlantic Ocean. Pacific coverage includes Hawaii and the Gulf of Alaska. This is accomplished by two satellites, GOES West located at 135 west longitude and GOES East at 75 west longitude. A common ground station, the CDA station located at Wallops, Virginia, supports the interface to both satellites. The NOAA Satellite Operations Control Center (SOCC), in Suitland, Maryland, provides spacecraft scheduling, health and safety monitoring, and engineering analyses.  Delivery of products involves ground processing of the raw instrument data for radiometric calibration and Earth location information, and retransmission to the satellite for relay to the data user community. The processed data are received at the control center and disseminated to the National Weather Service's (NWS) National Meteorological Center, Camp Springs, Maryland, and NWS forecast offices, including the National Hurricane Center, Miami, Florida, and the National Severe Storms Forecast Center, Kansas City, Missouri. Processed data are also received by Department of Defense installations, universities, and numerous private commercial users. *The GOES-9 satellite was replaced by GOES-10 in July 1998*  MAIN SPACECRAFT DESIGN ELEMENTS Mission life            5 years, minimum Dimensions  Main body              2 meter (7 foot) cube  Deployed length        27 meters (88 feet) Weight                  2100 kg (4600 lb) Orbit                   Geosynchronous  Altitude               36,000 km (22,000 mi)  Longitude              75W and 135W  Latitude               equatorial, within 0.5 degree Power                   1050 watts @ 42 volts, solar array; battery backup Launch vehicle          Atlas-I/Centaur (GOES-I/K), Atlas-II/Centaur (GOES-L/M) Communications          Imager and Sounder in GVAR format at 2.1 Mbits/sec GOES-I/M IMAGER The GOES Imager is a multi-channel instrument designed to sense radiant and solar-reflected energy from sampled areas of the Earth.

Mariner 2 was a backup for the Mariner 1 mission which failed shortly after launch to Venus. The objective of the Mariner 2 mission was to fly by Venus and return data on the planet's atmosphere, magnetic field, charged particle environment, and mass. It also made measurements of the interplanetary medium during its cruise to Venus and after the flyby. \n\nSpacecraft and Subsystems \n\nMariner 2 consisted of a hexagonal base, 1.04 meters across and 0.36 meters thick, which contained six magnesium chassis housing the electronics for the science experiments, communications, data encoding, computing, timing, and attitude control, and the power control, battery, and battery charger, as well as the attitude control gas bottles and the rocket engine. On top of the base was a tall pyramid-shaped mast on which the science experiments were mounted which brought the total height of the spacecraft to 3.66 meters. Attached to either side of the base were rectangular solar panel wings with a total span of 5.05 meters and width of 0.76 meters. Attached by an arm to one side of the base and extending below the spacecraft was a large directional dish antenna. \n\nThe Mariner 2 power system consisted of the two solar cell wings, one 183 cm by 76 cm and the other 152 cm by 76 cm (with a 31 cm dacron extension (a solar sail) to balance the solar pressure on the panels) which powered the craft directly or recharged a 1000 Watt-hour sealed silver-zinc cell battery, which was used before the panels were deployed, when the panels were not illuminated by the Sun, and when loads were heavy. A power-switching and booster regulator device controlled the power flow. Communications consisted of a 3 Watt transmitter capable of continuous telemetry operation, the large high gain directional dish antenna, a cylindrical omnidirectional antenna at the top of the instrument mast, and two command antennas, one on the end of either solar panel, which received instructions for midcourse maneuvers and other functions. \n\nPropulsion for midcourse maneuvers was supplied by a monopropellant (anhydrous hydrazine) 225 N retro-rocket. The hydrazine was ignited using nitrogen tetroxide and aluminum oxide pellets, and thrust direction was controlled by four jet vanes situated below the thrust chamber. Attitude control with a 1 degree pointing error was maintained by a system of nitrogen gas jets. The Sun and Earth were used as references for attitude stabilization. Overall timing and control was performed by a digital Central Computer and Sequencer. Thermal control was achieved through the use of passive reflecting and absorbing surfaces, thermal shields, and movable louvers. \n\nThe scientific experiments were mounted on the instrument mast and base. A magnetometer was attached to the top of the mast below the omnidirectional antenna. Particle detectors were mounted halfway up the mast, along with the cosmic ray detector.

The F3C mission was successfully launched on 15 April 2006. Six identical micro satellites, each carrying an advanced GPS radio occultation (RO) receiver, a Tiny Ionospheric Photometer (TIP) and a Tri Band Beacon (TBB) were deployed. The satellites have since been raised by Taiwan's National Space Organization (NSPO) to their final orbit altitude at 800km to achieve an operational constellation of six orbital planes separated by 30 degrees. The payload science data are currently being downloaded every orbit via two NOAA TT&C stations (in Alaska and Norway) and one NSF/NASA station in McMurdo, Antarctica and transferred to the COSMIC Data Analysis and Archival Center (CDAAC) at UCAR in Boulder. The CDAAC currently processes the COSMIC science data in near real time - Ninety percent of RO profiles are delivered to operational weather centers within 3 hours of observation. CDAAC also reprocesses data in a more accurate post-processed mode (within 6 weeks of observation) for COSMIC as well as other missions including GPS/MET, CHAMP, SAC-C, and GRACE.\n\nCOSMIC is currently providing between 1000-2500 daily RO profiles in the neutral atmosphere, 1000-2500 daily electron density profiles and total electron content arcs, and TIP radiance products. The data have already demonstrated their value for operational weather forecasting, hurricane forecasting, and investigations of the atmospheric boundary layer. The data have been used extensively to test ionospheric models and their use in operational space weather models is under development. COSMIC GPS RO data also have the potential to be of great benefit to climate studies due to their demonstrated high precision and global and diurnal sampling coverage.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Solar/Space Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3\n      Long_Name: Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: FORMSAT 3A\n      Short_Name: FORMSAT 3B\n      Short_Name: FORMSAT 3C\n      Short_Name: FORMSAT 3D\n      Short_Name: FORMSAT 3E\n      Short_Name: FORMSAT 3F\n      Short_Name: 2006-011A\n      Short_Name: 2006-011B\n      Short_Name: 2006-011C\n      Short_Name: 2006-011D\n      Short_Name: 2006-011E\n      Short_Name: 2006-011F\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: RO\n      Short_Name: TBB\n      Short_Name: TIP\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Inclination: 72 degrees\n      Period: 95 m\n      Perigee: 496 km\n      Apogee: 540 km\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Inclined Non-Polar\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www.cosmic.ucar.edu/\n   Online_Resource: http://cosmic-io.cosmic.ucar.edu/cdaac/\n   Online_Resource: http://www.nspo.org.tw/2008e/projects/project3/hot.shtml?right=no\n   Sample_Image: http://www.cosmic.ucar.edu/images/rocksat.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2006-04-15\n      Launch_Site: Vandenberg Air Force Base, USA\n      Design_Life: 5 years\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NSF/UCAR\n      Primary_Sponsor: TAIWAN/NSPO\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/DOD/USAF\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NOAA\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/DOD/ONR\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "GACM": {"short_name": "GACM", "long_name": "Global Atmospheric Composition Mission", "description": "[Source: NASA Earth Science Decadal Survey Studies, \nhttp://decadal.gsfc.nasa.gov/gacm.html ]\n\nGACM will enable scientists to better understand the relationship between atmospheric ozone distribution and the factors that alter it. \n\nMission objectives:\n\n    * Ozone and related gases for intercontinental air quality and stratospheric ozone layer prediction\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: GACM\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: NASA Decadal Survey\n      Short_Name: GACM\n      Long_Name: Global Atmospheric Composition Mission\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: MLS\n      Short_Name: UV SPECTROMETER\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2010-05-04\n   Online_Resource: http://decadal.gsfc.nasa.gov/gacm.html\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "AD-C": {"short_name": "AD-C", "long_name": "Atmosphere Dynamics C (Explorer 39)", "description": "Explorer 39 was an inflatable sphere, 3.6 m in diameter.

Other consortium members are Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL), Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) designed and Infoterra.\n\nThe satellite is designed to return its data directly to a mobile ground station immediately after collecting an image, allowing far more timely delivery of the information which it collects than standard satellites. The system is specifically designed to meet operational timescales, whether for disaster relief, news-gathering, or other applications where speed of response is vital.\n\nTopSat received the Aviation and Space Grand Award \u2013 the top award for aerospace technology, from Popular Science, the best selling science and technology magazine in the world. The magazine\u2019s editors concluded that TopSat is an innovation that has the potential to change satellite and space reconnaissance technology.\n\nTopSat weighs just 120 kg, but carries an optical camera capable of delivering panchromatic images with a spatial resolution at nadir of 2.8 metres covering a 17x17 km area, and simultaneous three-band multi-spectral images, (red, green, blue), with a resolution of 5.6 metres. This is thought to represent the best resolution per mass of any satellite launched to date. This camera is integrated with an agile micro-satellite platform to permit pitch compensation manoeuvres, allowing imaging of low illumination scenes.\n\nTopSat has been in operation since its launch from Plesetsk in Russia on 27th October 2005. The satellite can be reprogrammed in orbit, and the consortium is exploiting this to enhance its performance. In addition to actively pursuing experiments for the MOD and BNSC, the consortium is also seeking new applications to which the technology can be applied. In the future, a constellation of three or four TopSat satellites could image almost any point on the Earth at least once a day, further opening up the potential for quick response imagery which is extremely cost effective to deliver.\n\n[Information from QinetiQ Ltd.]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: TOPSAT\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: TOPSAT\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: CAMERAS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Inclination: 98.1\n      Period: 98.6\n      Repeat_Cycle: 4\n      Perigee: 688.4\n      Apogee: 714\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-06-18\n   Online_Resource: http://www.qinetiq.com/home/defence/defence_solutions/space/topsat.html\n   Online_Resource: http://earth.esa.int/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=5135\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2005-10-27\n      Launch_Site: Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia\n      Primary_Sponsor: QinetiQ Ltd.\n      Primary_Sponsor: Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd.

The MSG satellites carry an impressive pair of instruments, the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI), which has the capacity to observe the Earth in 12 spectral channels and provide image data which is core to operational forecasting needs, and the Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget (GERB) instrument supporting climate studies.\n\nMore Information: \nhttp://www.eumetsat.int/Home/Main/Satellites/MeteosatSecondGeneration/MissionOverview/index.htm?l=en\n\n\nThe Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) system is being established through cooperation between EUMETSAT and the European Space Agency (ESA). ESA has already contributed to the initial research and development of the new satellites. The first MTG-I and MTG-S prototypes are being developed by ESA as part of its MTG programme. The EUMETSAT MTG programme includes the procurement of the four recurrent satellites - three MTG-Is and one additional MTG-S - as well as six launches, the development of the ground segment and the operations of all satellites.\n\nThe Euronews video (right) provides a useful introduction to past and future developments in European satellite meteorology, with particular reference to the MTG programme.\nThe MTG series will comprise six satellites, with the first spacecraft likely to be ready for launch from 2017. The in orbit configuration will consist of two parallel positioned satellites, the MTG-I (imager) and the MTG-S (sounder) platforms. Unlike the  first and second generation Meteosat series, MTG will be based on three axes stabilised platforms having the advantage that the instruments are 100% of their in orbit time pointed to the Earth.  Such improvements are necessary to achieve compliance with more demanding user requirements on spatial resolution, repeat cycle and signal to noise ratio, and are a prerequisite to conduct soundings from geostationary orbit.\nMTG-I satellites will fly the Flexible Combined Imager (FCI) and an imaging lightning detection instrument the Lightning Imager (LI). The MTG-S will include an interferometer the InfraRed Sounder (IRS) with hyper-spectral resolution in the thermal spectral domain, and the Sentinel-4 instrument, the high resolution Ultraviolet Visible Near-infrared (UVN) spectrometer.\nThe programme should guarantee access to space-acquired meteorological data until at least the late 2030s.\n\nhttp://www.eumetsat.int/Home/Main/Satellites/MeteosatThirdGeneration/index.htm?l=en\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: METEOSAT\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: METEOSAT\n      Short_Name: METEOSAT\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www.eumetsat.int/Home/Main/Satellites/MeteosatFirstGeneration/index.htm?l=en\n   Online_Resource: http://www.eumetsat.int/Home/Main/Satellites/MeteosatSecondGeneration/MissionOverview/index.htm?l=en\n   Online_Resource: http://www.eumetsat.int/Home/Main/Satellites/MeteosatThirdGeneration/index.htm?l=en\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1977-12-09\n      Primary_Sponsor: ESA\n      Primary_Sponsor: EUMETSAT\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "TIROS-M": {"short_name": "TIROS-M", "long_name": "Television Infrared Observation Satellite-M", "description": "The ITOS (Improved Tiros Operational Satellite) series (TIROS-M\nwas the prototype spacecraft) were the second generation of\noperational sun-synchronous meteorological\nspacecraft.

Secondary\nobjectives included providing both solar proton and global heat\nbalance data on a regular daily basis. To accomplish these\ntasks, the spacecraft carried:\n\n-two television cameras for Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) and\n-two Advanced Vidicon Camera System (AVCS) cameras.

These data served as raw material to optimize computer models for meteorological prediction.  It was hoped that determination could be made of the time limitation for short-term modeling.  The GMS series has been used for the World Meteorological Organization's World Weather Watch. The satellite was spin-stabilized with a despun earth-pointing antenna.  The GMS series carried the Visible and Spin Scan Radiometer (VISSR).  Launched by a US Delta rocket in July 1977, the satellite was positioned near 140 deg E.

Daily image coverage of Taiwan and the surrounding region is required.\n\nBackground: A contract was signed in May 1999 between NSPO and DASA/DSS (Dornier Satelliten Systeme GmbH) of Germany to build a high-resolution optical imaging satellite. However, the German government refused to give DASA/DSS an export licence for the S/C (the People's Republic of China was protesting the deal). The stalemate was resolved in Dec. 1999 when NSPO signed a new contract with MMS (now Astrium SAS of France). Quick approval of the export of ROCSat-2 was provided by the French government. The ROCSat program is part of a long-term effort in Taiwan to develop an autonomous space capability.\n\nNote: A public naming competition took place in Taiwan in 2004 with regard to the ROCSat satellite program. At the end of this contest, the ROCSat program was given the new name of FormoSat in December 2004. Hence, ROCSat-2 became FormoSat-2. \n\nSpacecraft:\n\nThe spacecraft bus has been built by EADS Astrium SAS (prime contractor) of V\u00e9lizy, France, based on the Leostar 500 XO family. There were also contributions from Taiwanese industry (including satellite computers, S-band antennas, and sun sensors). The S/C structure consists basically of a hexagonal body of 1.6 m side length (diameter), 2.4 m in height. The satellite is three-axis stabilized. The upper deck of the platform carries the payload (RSI and ISUAL) and also part of AOCS (Attitude and Orbit Control Subsystem), namely the star sensors and gyroscopes. The lower deck carries the four reaction wheels and the autonomous propulsion module. The pointing accuracy is &lt; 0.7 km (0.12\u00ba); the position knowledge is &lt; 70 m (0.02\u00ba). The fixed solar array uses GaAs cells and consists of two deployable flaps. The entire S/C architecture is designed in such a way as to provide a low roll inertia, a key factor for satellite agility and instrument line-of-sight stability. The S/C provides a body-pointing capability of \u00b145\u00ba in roll and pitch (45\u00ba pitch in 60 s, 10\u00ba roll in 25 s, 30\u00ba roll in 60 s, respectively). The S/C wet mass is about 746 kg with 81 kg of propellant (N2H4) mass. The design life is five years or better.\n\nLaunch: A launch of ROCSat-2 took place on May 20, 2004 (UTC) on a Taurus-XL vehicle of OSC (Orbital Sciences Corporation) from VAFB, CA (maiden flight of Taurus-XL configuration which offers greater lift capability compared to previous versions of the Taurus rocket).\n\nOrbit: Sun-synchronous circular orbit, mean altitude = 888 km, inclination = 99.14\u00ba, period of 102.9 minutes, the LTDN (Local Time of Descending Node) is 9:26 AM (14 orbits/day). The agility of the spacecraft provides a daily revisit capability for event/disaster monitoring.\n\nNote: Following the early-orbit checkout, the initial satellite orbit has been raised from 728 km to 888 km altitude in the period May 23 to June 2, 2004. A total of 32 burns were performed by the propulsion module with 4 burns for inclination change, to enter into the mission orbit with an altitude of 891 km and an inclination of 99.14\u00ba.\n\nGround segment: The basic elements of the ROCSat-2 ground segment are the MMC (Multi Mission Center) and the XAS (X-band Acquisition System) located in Hsinchu, Taiwan. MMC in turn consists of MOC (Mission Operations Center), MCC (Mission Control Center), SCC (Science Control Center), FDF (Flight Dynamics Facility), and GCN (Ground Communications Network). ROCSat-2 X-band imagery reception is also made available to third parties (international partners) with their own ground stations through cooperative agreements.\n\nMission status: The spacecraft and its payload are operating nominally as of 2007.\n\nMission operations started in June 2004 (the checkout and performance verification for satellite bus and RSI were started on May 21 and completed through June 2004; all performance requirements of FormoSat-2 had been successfully verified in orbit). Besides providing imagery for the domestic needs of Taiwan, the S/C is frequently being used to deliver high-resolution imagery for event monitoring (coverage of the Tsunami in Asia on Dec. 26, 2004 and thereafter, coverage of Hurricane Katarina in Aug. 2005, coverage of Typhoons on the Pacific, coverage of earthquake regions, etc.). The spacecraft is operating nominally as of 2006. 7) 8) 9) 10)\n\n\u2022 NSPO has contracted to SPOT Image S.A. for the international distribution of FORMOSAT-2 images since June 2004\n\n\u2022 On 4 July 2004, ISUAL successfully observed the first images of sprites, sprite halo, and elves.\n\n\u2022 In April 2005, NSPO implemented a terminal in Kiruna, Sweden, to serve as an additional receiving station\n\n\u2022 In May 2006, NSPO implemented a F2T (FormoSat-2 Terminal) in Svalbard, Norway, to extend the data acquisition capability of the mission.\n\nSOH (State-of-Health) trending during two years of mission operations (May 2004-May 2006) on five major subsystems, including AOCS and EPS (Electric Propulsion Subsystem), and one major payload have been conducted. All parameters were well within specifications. The C&amp;DH and the TT&amp;C do not exhibit any SOH problems so far.\n\nRSI (Remote Sensing Instrument), built by EADS Astrium SAS, France. RSI is made up of the camera and IPU (Instrument Processing Unit). The camera itself consists of the optical subassembly, the secondary structure, and the FPA (Focal Plane Assembly). The Korsch telescope (mirrors &amp; structure) design and the focal plane structure are being made of SiC (Silicon Carbide). The video electronics, sequencer, DC/DC converter, and compression cards comprise the IPU.\n\nRSI utilizes the agility of the satellite bus for stereo imaging over a specific region, continuous imaging over a slender region, and mosaic imaging over a large region. The imaging capability is 8 minutes per orbit, and the imaging areas during one cycle can be one 3000 km x 24 km continuous strip, two 100 km x 24 km stereo pairs, four 100 km x 24 km strips, or eight scenes.\n\nISUAL (Imager of Sprites: Upper Atmospheric Lightning). ISUAL is a joint international research program of NSPO, UCB (University of California at Berkeley), National Cheng Kung University of Taiwan, and Tohoku University, Japan. The objective is to observe the natural upward lightning discharge phenomena toward the ionosphere on top of the troposphere, referred to as TLEs (Transient Luminous Events). The requirements call for: 14)\n\n\u2022 To determine the location and timing of luminous phenomena above thunder clouds to investigate their spatial, temporal and spectral properties\n\n\u2022 To obtain a global survey of upper atmospheric optical flash transients (sprites, elves, blue jets, gigantic jets, etc.).\n\nThe instrument consists of four elements: a) intensified sprite imager, b) a six-channel spectrophotometer, c) a two-channel array photometer, and d) an electronics package. The imager is a staring-type frame CCD camera, taking 180 frames/s with a resolution of 512 x 80 pixels in a FOV of 20\u00ba x 3.15\u00ba. In Figure 8, the large disk of the ISUAL instrument contains six color filters, which can be rotated to select wavelength for measuring the emission spectrum of red sprites. ISUAL is operated in three modes:\n\n\u2022 The sprite continuous mode to take images with a sample rate of 100 Hz\n\n\u2022 The sprite burst mode with a sample rate of 1000 Hz\n\n\u2022 The auroral mode at a constant rate of 1 sample/s. \n\nInformation obtained from http://www.eoportal.org/\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: FORMOSAT-2\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: FORMOSAT-2\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: ROCSat-2\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: CAMERAS\n      Short_Name: MS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 888 km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 99.14 degrees\n      Equator_Crossing: 9:30 am\n      Period: 103 minutes\n      Repeat_Cycle: 1\n      Orbit_Type: LEO &gt; Low Earth Orbit &gt; Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-09\n   Online_Resource: http://www.nspo.org.tw/2008e/projects/project2/intro.htm\n   Online_Resource: http://www.spotimage.com/web/en/977--formosat-2-images.php\n   Online_Resource: http://www.satimagingcorp.com/satellite-sensors/formosat-2.html\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2004-05-20\n      Launch_Site: Vandenberg Air Force Base, USA\n      Design_Life: 5 years\n      Primary_Sponsor: National Space Program Office (NSPO), China\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "UK-DMC": {"short_name": "UK-DMC", "description": "SSTL developed the UK-DMC-1 satellite (also known as BNSCsat-1) for the British National Space Centre (BNSC) under a grant from the Microsatellite Applications in Collaboration (MOSAIC) programme.

Like all of the standard DMC satellites, it carries an optical imaging payload developed by SSTL to provide 32-m ground resolution with an exceptionally wide swath width of over 640 km. The payload uses green, red and near infrared bands equivalent to Landsat TM+ bands 2, 3 and 4. In comparison to the other DMC satellites, UK-DMC features increased on-board data storage, with 1.5 gigabyte capacity. Images are returned to the SSTL mission operations centre using the Internet Protocol over an 8-Mbps S-band downlink.\n\nUK-DMC also contains a commercial Internet router from Cisco Systems, which builds on the use of the Internet Protocol by the DMC satellites to experiment with Internet packet routing to and in space.\n\nUK-DMC has also provided an opportunity for SSTL to test a new concept in remote sensing, GPS reflectometry. This technique, which measures the signals from the GPS navigation system after they are reflected off the sea, could revolutionize oceanographic remote sensing. If UK-DMC validates theories of GPS reflectometry, the technique could one day enable satellites to measure the height of waves on the high seas, providing important data to ship owners and operators. SSTL is using imagery from the UK-DMC to investigate the full range of uses for large-coverage images with medium spatial resolution and high temporal resolution.

The primary structural members were a honeycombed equipment shelf and thrust tube.  The VISSR telescope was mounted on the equipment shelf and viewed the Earth through a special aperture in the side of the spacecraft.  A support structure extended radially out from the thrust tube and was affixed to the solar panels, which formed the outer walls of the spacecraft and provided the primary source of electrical power.  Located in the annulus-shaped space between the thrust tube and the solar panels were stationkeeping and dynamics control equipment, batteries, and most of the SEM equipment.

The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) is a Department of Defense (DoD) program run by the Air Force Space and Missle Systems Center (SMC). The program designs, builds, launches, and maintains satellites monitoring the meteorological, oceanographic, and solar-terrestrial physics environments. Each DMSP satellite has a 101 minute, sun-synchronous near-polar orbit at an altitude of 830km above the surface of the earth. The visible and infrared sensors (OLS) collect images across a 3000 km swath, providing global coverage twice per day. The combination of day/night and dawn/dusk satellites allows monitoring of global information such as clouds every 6 hours. The microwave imager (SSMI) and sounders (SSMT1, SSMT2) cover one half the width of the visible and infrared swath. These instruments cover polar regions at least twice and the equatorial region once per day. The space environment sensors (SSJ, SSM, SSIES) record along-track plasma densities, velocities, composition and drifts (SS stands for Special Sensor).\n\nDMSP F16 carries two new experiments: the limb scanning ultraviolet imager/spectrometer SSULI built by the Naval Research Laboratory and the nadir scanning ultaviolet imager/spectrometer and photometer SSUSI built by the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University. It also carried new versions of the Special Sensor for Ions, Electrons and Scintillations (SSIES-13) and of the precipitating ion and electron monitor (SSJ-5)\n\nThe data from the DMSP satellites are received and used at operational centers continuously. The data are sent to the National Geophysical Data Center's Solar Terrestrial Physics Division (NGDC/STP) by the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) for creation of an archive. \n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: DMSP 5D-3/F16\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: DMSP (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program)\n      Short_Name: DMSP 5D-3/F16\n      Long_Name: Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-F16\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: DMSP-F16\n      Short_Name: USA 172\n      Short_Name: 28054\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: SSULI\n      Short_Name: OLS\n      Short_Name: SSM/T\n      Short_Name: SSIES\n      Short_Name: SSJ/4\n      Short_Name: SSM/I\n      Short_Name: SSM/T-2\n      Short_Name: SSM\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 830km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 98.9\u00b0\n      Period: 101.9 minutes\n      Perigee: 843.0 km\n      Apogee: 853.0 km\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-10-31\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=2003-048A\n   Online_Resource: http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/dmsp/\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2003-10-18\n      Launch_Site: Vandenberg Air Force Base, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: Department of Defense-Department of the Air Force (United States)\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "FY-3A": {"short_name": "FY-3A", "long_name": "FengYun-3A", "description": "Storm III (FY-3) satellite is China's second-generation polar orbit meteorological satellite, which is the basis of FY-1 meteorological satellite technology on the development and improvement in function and technology a big step forward with qualitative change, specific requirements to solve the three-dimensional atmospheric detection, ability to obtain substantial increase in global data to further enhance the cloud and surface characteristics of remote sensing capabilities, enabling access to global, all-weather, three-dimensional, quantitative, multi-spectral atmosphere, surface and sea surface parameters.

On Tuesday April 1,\n2003 GOES-12 (Formerly Referred to as GOES-M) replaced GOES-8 as the\noperational GOES East Satellite. NOAA deactivated the satellite on May\n5, 2004 and will boost it into an orbit 350 kilometers above its\noriginal geostationary position, where it will be disposed safely in\nthree controlled burns.\n\nGOES I-M represented the next generation of meteorological satellites\nand introduces two new features.  The first feature, flexible scan,\noffers small-scale area imaging that lets meteorologists take pictures\nof local weather trouble spots. This allows them to improve short-term\nforecasts over local areas. The second feature, simultaneous and\nindependent imaging and sounding, is designed to allow weather\nforecasters to use multiple measurements of weather phenomena to\nincrease the accuracy of their forecasts.\n\nEach satellite in the series carries two major instruments: an Imager\nand a Sounder. These instruments acquire high resolution visible and\ninfrared data, as well as temperature and moisture profiles of the\natmosphere. They continuously transmit these data to ground terminals\nwhere the data are processed for rebroadcast to primary weather\nservices both in the United States and around the world, including the\nglobal research community.\n\nThe GOES I-M mission ran from the mid-1990s into the\nfirst decade of the 21st century.  Each element of the mission has\nbeen designed to meet all in-orbit performance requirements for at\nleast five years.\n\nThe GOES I-M system performed the following basic functions:\n+ Acquisition, processing, and dissemination of imaging and\nsounding data.\n+ Acquisition and dissemination of Space Environment Monitor\n(SEM) data.\n+ Reception and relay of data from ground-based Data Collection\nPlatforms (DCPs) that are situated in carefully selected urban and\nremote areas to the NOAA Command and Data Acquisition (CDA) station.\n+ Continuous relay of Weather Facsimile (WEFAX) and other data to\nusers, independent of all other functions.\n+ Relay of distress signals from people, aircraft, or marine vessels\nto the search and rescue ground stations of the Search and Rescue\nSatellite Aided Tracking (SARSAT) system.\nGOES provides the instantaneous relay functions for the SARSAT system.\nA dedicated search and rescue transponder on board GOES is designed to\ndetect emergency distress signals originating from Earth-based\nsources. These unique identification signals are normally combined\nwith signals received by a low-Earth orbiting satellite system and\nrelayed to a search and rescue ground terminal. The combined data are\nused to perform effective search and rescue operations.\nThe GOES I-M system serves a region covering the central and eastern\nPacific Ocean; North, Central, and South America; and the central and\nwestern Atlantic Ocean. Pacific coverage includes Hawaii and the Gulf\nof Alaska. This is accomplished by two satellites, GOES West located\nat 135 west longitude and GOES East at 75 west longitude. A common\nground station, the CDA station located at Wallops, Virginia,\nsupports the interface to both satellites. The NOAA Satellite\nOperations Control Center (SOCC), in Suitland, Maryland, provides\nspacecraft scheduling, health and safety monitoring, and engineering\nanalyses.\n\nDelivery of products involves ground processing of the raw instrument\ndata for radiometric calibration and Earth location information, and\nretransmission to the satellite for relay to the data user community.\nThe processed data are received at the control center and disseminated\nto the National Weather Service's (NWS) National Meteorological\nCenter, Camp Springs, Maryland, and NWS forecast offices, including\nthe National Hurricane Center, Miami, Florida, and the National Severe\nStorms Forecast Center, Kansas City, Missouri.

The instrument can produce full-Earth\ndisc images, sector images that contain the edges of the Earth, and\nvarious sizes of area scans completely enclosed within the Earth scene\nusing a new flexible scan system.

The Atmospheric Physics investigations conducted studies of the earth's environment through surveys of temperature, composition, and motion of the atmosphere.  The Earth Observations investigations used and evaluated the capability of advanced measuring systems for making topographic and thematic maps from high-resolution photographs and from remote-sensing data.  Investigations in the Space Plasma Physics group studied the charged particle or plasma environment of the earth.  The Astronomy investigations studied astronomical sources of radiation in the ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths.  The Solar Physics investigations measured the total energy output of the sun using three different methods with the instruments cross calibrated so that meaningful comparisons could be made.  The Material Sciences and Technology investigations took advantage of the microgravity conditions to perform studies in such areas as crystal growth, metallurgy, tribology, fluid physics, and ceramics technology.  The Life Sciences investigations were concerned with the effects of the space environment (zero gravity and high-energy radiation) on human physiology and on the growth, development, and organization of biological systems.  The mission was considered very successful.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: SPACELAB-1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Space Stations/Manned Spacecraft\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: SPACE SHUTTLE\n      Short_Name: SPACELAB-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Inclination: 57 degrees\n      Perigee: 242 km\n      Apogee: 254 km\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-01-25\n   Online_Resource: http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/missions/spacelab1.html\n   Online_Resource: http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/sats_n_data/missions/spacelab1.html\n   Sample_Image: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Leroy_Chiao_inside_Destiny_space_lab.jpg/800px-Leroy_Chiao_inside_Destiny_space_lab.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1983-11-28\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "MESONET": {"short_name": "MESONET", "long_name": "Mesoscale Meteorological Network", "description": "Mesoscale Meteorological Network (MESONET) are world-class network of environmental monitoring stations that gather current meteorological observations and send the data to their corresponding centers.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: MESONET\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: In Situ Land-based Platforms\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: WEATHER STATIONS/NETWORKS\n      Short_Name: MESONET\n      Long_Name: Mesoscale Meteorological Network\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: Mesonet\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-12-12\n   Online_Resource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesonet\n   Sample_Image: http://www.srh.noaa.gov/mlb/digest/issue23/mesonet-map.jpg\nEnd_Group"}, "R/V XUELONG": {"short_name": "R/V XUELONG"}, "GPM": {"short_name": "GPM", "long_name": "Global Precipitation Measurement", "description": "[Text Source: NASA Science Missions Directorate Homepage, https://pmm.nasa.gov/GPM ]\n\nGPM Constellation is a joint mission with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and other international partners. Building upon the success of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), it will initiate the measurement of global precipitation, a key climate factor. Its science objectives are: to improve ongoing efforts to predict climate by providing near-global measurement of precipitation, its distribution, and physical processes; to improve the accuracy of weather and precipitation forecasts through more accurate measurement of rain rates and latent heating; and to provide more frequent and complete sampling of the Earth's precipitation. GPM Constellation is envisioned to consist of a core spacecraft to measure precipitation structure and to provide a calibration standard for the constellation spacecraft, an international constellation of NASA and contributed spacecraft to provide frequent precipitation measurements on a global basis, calibration/validation sites distributed globally with a broad array of precipitation-measuring instrumentation, and a global precipitation data system to produce and distribute global rain maps and climate research products.\n\nThe GPM Core Observatory carries the first space-borne Ku/Ka-band Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) and a multi-channel GPM Microwave Imager (GMI). The DPR instrument, which provides three dimensional measurements of precipitation structure over 78 and 152 mile (125 and 245 km) swaths, consists of a Ka-band precipitation radar (KaPR) operating at 35.5 GHz and a Ku-band precipitation radar (KuPR) operating at 13.6 GHz. Relative to the TRMM precipitation radar, the DPR is more sensitive to light rain rates and snowfall. In addition, simultaneous measurements by the overlapping of Ka/Ku-bands of the DPR can provide new information on particle drop size distributions over moderate precipitation intensities. In addition, by providing new microphysical measurements from the DPR to complement cloud and aerosol observations, GPM is expected to provide further insights into how precipitation processes may be affected by human activities.\n\nThe GMI instrument is a conical-scanning multi-channel microwave radiometer covering a swath of 550 miles (885 km) with thirteen channels ranging in frequency from 10 GHz to 183 GHz. The GMI uses a set of frequencies that have been optimized over the past two decades to retrieve heavy, moderate and light precipitation using the polarization difference at each channel as an indicator of the optical thickness and water content.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: GPM\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: GPM\n      Long_Name: Global Precipitation Measurement\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: GMI\n      Short_Name: DPR\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Non-Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2009-02-25\n   Online_Resource: https://pmm.nasa.gov/GPM\n   Online_Resource: http://global.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/gpm/index.html\n   Online_Resource: http://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/GPM/index_e.htm\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2014-01-25\n      Launch_Site: TANEGASHIMA ISLAND, JAPAN\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n      Primary_Sponsor: JAPAN/JAXA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "AE-E": {"short_name": "AE-E", "long_name": "Atmosphere Explorer E (Explorer 55)", "description": "The Atmospheric Explorer-E (AE-E) spacecraft (Designation: 08440 /\n75107A) was designed as a multi- sided polyhedron shaped frame with a\nmean diameter of 1.4 meters.

Each Voyager had as its major objectives at each planet to: (1) investigate the circulation, dynamics, structure, and composition of the planet's atmosphere; (2) characterize the morphology, geology, and physical state of the satellites of the planet; (3) provide improved values for the mass, size, and shape of the planet, its satellites, and any rings; and, (4) determine the magnetic field structure and characterize the composition and distribution of energetic trapped particles and plasma therein.\n\nOriginally planned as a Grand Tour of the outer planets, including dual launches to Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto in 1976-77 and dual launches to Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune in 1979, budgetary constraints caused a dramatic rescoping of the project to two spacecraft, each of which would go to only Jupiter and Saturn. The new mission was called Mariner Jupiter/Saturn, or MJS. It was subsequently renamed Voyager about six months prior to launch. The rescoped mission was estimated to cost $250 million (through the end of Saturn operations), only a third of what the Grand Tour design would have cost.\n\nVoyager 2 was the first of the two spacecraft to be launched, with liftoff occurring 20 Aug. 1977. What was at first an auspicious launch, however, proved to be the beginning of a number of problems. The primary cause of the initial problems were attributed to commanding by the AACS, including difficulty in determining the full deployment of the science boom. These problems resulted in a delay of four days in the launch of Voyager 1 to ensure they wouldn't occur for it.\n\nAlthough launched sixteen days after Voyager 2, Voyager 1's trajectory was the quicker one to Jupiter. On 15 Dec. 1977, while both spacecraft were in the asteroid belt, Voyager 1 surpassed Voyager 2's distance from the Sun.\n\nSeveral months after launch, in April 1978, Voyager 2's primary radio receiver failed, automatically kicking in the backup receiver which proved to be faulty. Attempts to recover the use of the primary receiver failed and the backup receiver was used for the remainder of the mission. Although use of the backup receiver made communication with the spacecraft more difficult, engineers were able to find workarounds.\n\nVoyager 2 proceeded with its primary mission and flew by Jupiter (closest approach on 09 July 1979) and Saturn (05 Aug. 1981). During these flybys, Voyager 2 obtained images roughly equal in number to Voyager 1 (18,000 at Jupiter, 16,000 at Saturn).\n\nVoyager 2's launch date had preserved one part of the original Grand Tour design, i.e. the possibility of an extended mission to Uranus and Neptune. Despite the difficulties encountered, scientists and engineers had been able to make Voyager enormously successful. As a result, approval was granted to extend the mission, first to Uranus, then to Neptune and later to continue observations well past Neptune. Voyager 2 made successful flybys of Uranus (24 Jan. 1986) and Neptune (25 Aug. 1989). Because of the additional distance of these two planets, adaptations had to made to accomodate the lower light levels and decreased communications. Voyager 2 was successfully able to obtain about 8,000 images of Uranus and its satellites. Additional improvements in the on-board software and use of image compression techniques allowed about 10,000 images of Neptune and its satellites to be taken.\n\nAll of the experiments on Voyager 2 have produced useful data. \n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: VOYAGER 2\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Interplanetary Spacecraft\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: FLYBY\n      Short_Name: VOYAGER 2\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: Mariner Jupiter/Saturn B\n      Short_Name: 10271\n      Short_Name: 1977-076A\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-03-06\n   Online_Resource: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/voyager/index.html\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/database/MasterCatalog?sc=1977-076A\n   Sample_Image: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/image/spacecraft/voyager.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1977-08-20\n      Launch_Site: Cape Canaveral/Kennedy Space Center, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "ADEOS-I": {"short_name": "ADEOS-I", "long_name": "Advanced Earth Observing Satellite-I", "description": "ADEOS (ADvanced Earth Observation Satellite), developed by the Japanese space agency JAXA.

The program, in place since 1982, has saved about 18,000 lives.\n\nNOAA-N is the first in a series of polar-orbiting satellites to be part of a joint cooperation project with the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMESTAT). \n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: NOAA-18\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: NOAA POES (Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites)\n      Short_Name: NOAA-18\n      Long_Name: National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration-18\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: NOAA-N\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: SARR\n      Short_Name: SEM-2\n      Short_Name: AVHRR-3\n      Short_Name: HIRS/4\n      Short_Name: AMSU-A\n      Short_Name: MHS\n      Short_Name: SBUV/2\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Inclination: 98.74 deg\n      Period: 102.1 min\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-11-08\n   Online_Resource: http://goespoes.gsfc.nasa.gov/poes/spacecraft/noaan_spacecraft.html\n   Online_Resource: http://www2.ncdc.noaa.gov/docs/klm/nnpsupp.htm\n   Online_Resource: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/noaa-n/main/index.html\n   Online_Resource: http://nasascience.nasa.gov/missions/noaa-n\n   Sample_Image: http://www.orbit.nesdis.noaa.gov/smcd/spb/mirs/img/NOAA18.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2005-05-20\n      Launch_Site: Vandenberg Air Force Base, USA\n      Design_Life: Greater than 2 years\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NOAA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "Space Stations/Manned Spacecraft": {"short_name": "Space Stations/Manned Spacecraft", "description": "Space Stations:  A space station is an artificial structure designed for \nhumans to live and work in outer space for a period of time.\n\n[Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station ]\n\nManned Spacecraft:  A vehicle, vessel or machine designed to (transport) \nhumans in outer space.\n[Source: Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft ]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: Space Stations/Manned Spacecraft\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Space Stations/Manned Spacecraft\n      Short_Name: Space Stations/Manned Spacecraft\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "SMS": {"short_name": "SMS", "long_name": "Synchronous Meteorological Satellites", "description": "The SMS satellite series (1 and 2) were spin-stabilized (100 rpm) and\noperated in a West-to-East, geo-synchronous orbit at an altitude of\n35,800 km (22,300 mi) above the equator.  These were the first and\nsecond prototypes for the GOES satellite series.  At this altitude it\ncircled the axis of the Earth once in 24 hours, making its speed\nsynonymous with the Earth's rotation, so that the satellite remained\nessentially stationary over a given geographical point. The two SMS\nsatellites were employed to provide overlapping coverage that centers\non the U.S. and extends over the eastern Atlantic Ocean and the\nwestern Pacific Ocean.  The scanning system consisted of a mirror that\nis stepped mechanically to provide North to South viewing, while the\nrotation of the satellite provided West to East scanning.  The mirror\nis stepped following each West to East scan, with each step resulting\nin a change in scan angle of 192 microradians, or 7 km near nadir.  A\nsequence of 1821 scans is performed to provide a 'full disk' view from\nthe Northern to the Southern Earth horizon.  At the rotation rate of\n100 rpm, 18.21 minutes are required to complete one full North to\nSouth view of the Earth.  The VISSR field of view provides a ground\nresolution of 0.9km in the visible, and 3.0km in the infrared.\nEntry taken from:\nCornillon, P., A Guide to Environmental Satellite Data, University of Rhode\nIsland Marine Technical Report 79, 1982.\nData Catalog Series for Space Science and Applications Flight Missions,\nNational Space Science Data Center/World Data Center A for Rockets and\nSatellites, Volume 2A, September 1982.\nData Catalog Series for Space Science and Applications Flight Missions,\nNational Space Science Data Center/World Data Center A for Rockets and\nSatellites, Volume 4A, July 1985.\nRao, P.K., S.J.

The satellite, primarily devoted to Earth observation, was in a highly\nelliptical initial orbit with a 272 km perigee and an 148,228 km apogee. The\norbital inclination was 31.1 degrees. The satellite took 3796 minutes to\ncomplete one orbit. Two experiments aboard OGO-5 produced cosmic high- energy\nresults, although their intended target was the Sun. The spacecraft attitude\ncontrol failed on 6 August 1971 and it was placed in a standby mode on 8\nOctober 1971. Three experiments (none of which were related to cosmic\nhigh-energy detection) were reactivated from 1 June to 13 July 1972. Operation\nof OGO 5 terminated completely on 14 July 1972.\n\nThe Anderson et al. (University of California, Berkeley) Energetic Radiations\nfrom Solar Flares experiment was operational from March 1968 - June 1971.\nPrimarily devoted to solar observations, it detected at least 11 cosmic X-ray\nbursts in time coincidence with gamma-ray bursts seen by other instruments. The\ndetector was a 0.5 cm thick NaI(Tl) crystal with a 9.5 sq-cm area. Data were\naccumulated into energy ranges of: 9.6-19.2, 19.2-32, 32-48, 48-64, 64-80,\n80-104, 104-128, and > 128 keV. The data were sampled for 1. 15 seconds once\nevery 2.3 seconds.\n\nThe gamma-ray instrument on-board, sensitive to energies from 25-100 MeV, was a\nsix gap spark chamber with an effective area of ~ 100 sq-cm. It was called the\nEnergetic Photons in Primary Cosmic Rays experiment (Hutchinson et al.,\nSouthampton University). It had an angular resolution of ~ 30 degrees (FWHM).\nThe satellite was Earth-pointing and passed regularly through the radiation\nbelts, which led to severe restrictions on the sky regions which could be\nexamined by the gamma-ray instrument. Other problems, such as an efficiency\nreduction in the anti-coincidence shield and data system difficulties, severely\ndegraded the scientific return from the experiment. Data collection ceased\naltogether after 5 months. Gamma-ray emission from the galactic plane was\nmonitored. No point sources were detected.\n\n[Summary provided by NASA.]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: OGO-5\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: OGO (Orbiting Geophysical Observatory)\n      Short_Name: OGO-5\n      Long_Name: Orbiting Geophysical Observatory-5\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: OGO-E\n      Short_Name: 03138\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: MAGNETOMETERS\n      Short_Name: SPECTROMETERS\n      Short_Name: GAMMA RADIATION DETECTOR\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Inclination: 31.1 degrees\n      Repeat_Cycle: 3796 minutes\n      Perigee: 272 km\n      Apogee: 148,228 km\n      Orbit_Type: HEO > Highly Elliptical Orbit\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-02-13\n   Online_Resource: http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/missions/ogo.html\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1968-014A\n   Sample_Image: http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Images/ogo/ogo.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1968-03-04\n      Launch_Site: Cape Canaveral/Kennedy Space Center, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "G-I": {"short_name": "G-I", "long_name": "GULFSTREAM I", "description": "Grumman developed the Gulfstream I turbine powered executive transport to replace the many hundred war surplus piston twins performing such missions in the mid 1950s.\n\nDesign work began in 1956, with first flight of the Gulfstream I prototype occurring on August 14 1958.

The cylindrically shaped spacecraft measured 190.5 cm in diameter and 230 cm in length, exclusive of a magnetometer that extended an additional 83 cm beyond the cylinder shell.  The primary structural members were a honeycombed equipment shelf and thrust tube.  The VISSR telescope was mounted on the equipment shelf and viewed the Earth through a special aperture in the side of the spacecraft.  A support structure extended radially from the thrust tube and was affixed to the solar panels, which formed the outer walls of the spacecraft and provided the primary source of electrical power.  Located in the annulus-shaped space between the thrust tube and the solar panels were stationkeeping and dynamics control equipment, batteries, and most of the SEM equipment.  Proper spacecraft attitude and spin rate (approximately 100 rpm) were maintained by two separate sets of jet thrusters mounted around the spacecraft equator and activated by ground command.  The spacecraft used both UHF-band and S-band frequencies in its telemetry and command subsystem.  A low-power VHF transponder provided telemetry and command during launch and then served as a backup for the primary subsystem once the spacecraft attained orbit. This spin-stabilized spacecraft carried a visible infrared spin-scan radiometer, meteorological data collection and relay system, space environment monitor, and a biaxial fluxgate magnetometer.  Throughout its 7 year history, it operated at 45, 75 and 92 degrees West.\n__________\nTaken from the NSSDC System for Information Retrieval and Storage (SIRS).

OGO 2 consisted of a main body, generally parallelepipedal in form, two rectangular solar panels, each with a solar-oriented experiment package (SOEP), and two orbital plane experiment packages (OPEP). It also included six experiment packages (EP-1,-2,-3,-4,-5, and -6) mounted on booms extending generally fore and aft of the spacecraft along the Y axis. Antenna and attitude control fixtures also extended from separate and/or EP booms. The main body was attitude-controlled by use of horizon scanners and gas jets and was designed to point toward the earth (Z axis). The axis connecting the two solar panels (X axis) was designed to oscillate in order to remain perpendicular to the earth-sun-spacecraft plane. The solar panels activated by sun sensors could rotate about this X axis in order to obtain maximum radiation for the solar cells and concurrently orient the SOEP properly. The OPEPs were reoriented on either end of an axis that was parallel to the Z axis and attached to the forward end of the main body. These OPEP sensors normally were maintained looking forward in the orbital plane of the satellite. To maintain this orientation, the OPEP axis could rotate over 90 deg. In addition, an angular difference of over 90 deg was possible between the orientation of the upper and lower OPEP packages. The SOEP contained four experiments, and the OPEP contained five experiments. Soon after achieving orbit, difficulties in maintaining earth lock with horizon scanners caused exhaustion of attitude control gas by October 23, 1965, 10 days after launch. At this time, the spacecraft entered a spin mode (about 0.11 rpm) with a large coning angle about the previously vertical axis. Five experiments became useless when the satellite went into this spin mode. Six additional experiments were degraded by this loss of attitude control. By April 1966, both batteries had failed, so subsequent observations were limited to sunlit portions of the orbit. By December 1966, only eight experiments were operational, five of which were not degraded by the spin mode operation. By April 1967, the tape recorders had malfunctioned and only one third of the recorded data could be processed. Spacecraft power and periods of operational scheduling conflicts created six large data gaps so that data were observed on a total of about 306 days of the 2-yr, 18-day total span of observed satellite data to November 1, 1967. The data gaps were (a) October 24, 1965, to November 5, 1965, (b) December 6, 1965, to January 7, 1966, (c) April 9, 1966, to June 21, 1966, (d) September 2, 1966, to November 18, 1966, (e) December 27, 1966, to April 11, 1967, and (f) May 9, 1967, to September 19, 1967. The spacecraft was shut down on November 1, 1967, with eight experiments still operational. It was reactivated for 2 weeks in February 1968 to operate experiment 65-081A-05. \n\n[Summary provided by NASA.]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: OGO-2\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: OGO (Orbiting Geophysical Observatory)\n      Short_Name: OGO-2\n      Long_Name: Orbiting Geophysical Observatory-2\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: OGO-C\n      Short_Name: POGO 1\n      Short_Name: 01620\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: SPECTROMETERS\n      Short_Name: MAGNETOMETERS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Inclination: 87.4 degrees\n      Period: 104.0 minutes\n      Perigee: 414.0 km\n      Apogee: 1510.0 km\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-02-13\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1965-081A\n   Sample_Image: http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Images/ogo/ogo.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1965-10-14\n      Launch_Site: Vandenberg Air Force Base, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "GLORY": {"short_name": "GLORY", "description": "[2011-03-04, NASA's Glory Satellite Fails To Reach Orbit] \n\n[Source: NASA Press Release 11-050, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2011/mar/HQ_11-050_N0_Glory.html ] \n\nWASHINGTON -- NASA's Glory mission launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California Friday at 5:09:45 a.m. EST failed to reach orbit. \n\nTelemetry indicated the fairing, the protective shell atop the Taurus XL rocket, did not separate as expected about three minutes after launch. \n\n//\n\n[Source: Glory Science Home Page, http://glory.giss.nasa.gov/ ]\n\nGlory is a remote-sensing Earth-orbiting observatory designed to achieve two separate mission objectives. One is to collect data on the chemical, microphysical, and optical properties, and spatial and temporal distributions of aerosols. The other is to continue collection of total solar irradiance data for the long-term climate record.\n\nThe Glory mission's scientific objectives are met by implementing two separate science instruments, one with the ability to collect polarimetric measurements along the satellite ground track within the solar reflective spectral region (0.4 to 2.4 micrometers) and one with the ability to monitor changes in sunlight incident on the Earth's atmosphere by collecting high accuracy, high precision measurements of total solar irradiance. Glory accomplishes these objectives by deploying two instruments aboard a low earth orbit satellite, the Aerosol Polarimetry Sensor (APS) and the Total Irradiance Monitor (TIM). Additionally, a cloud camera system will provide images that allow the APS scans along the spacecraft ground track to be put into spatial context and to facilitate determination of cloud occurrence within the APS instantaneous field of view.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: GLORY\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: GLORY\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: TIM\n      Short_Name: CC GLORY\n      Short_Name: APS GLORY\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 705 km +/- 30 km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 98.2 Degrees +/- 0.15 Degrees\n      Equator_Crossing: 1:35 p.m.\n      Period: 99 Minutes\n      Repeat_Cycle: 16 Days\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-11-09\n   Online_Resource: http://glory.giss.nasa.gov/\n   Online_Resource: http://glory.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n   Sample_Image: http://glory.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/gloryinorbit-s.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2011-03-04\n      Launch_Site: VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, USA\n      Design_Life: + 3 years; 5 year goal\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "R/V L'ASTRO": {"short_name": "R/V L'ASTRO", "long_name": "R/V L'ASTROLABE"}, "NOT APPLICABLE": {"short_name": "NOT APPLICABLE"}, "NCEP-GODAS": {"short_name": "NCEP-GODAS", "long_name": "NCEP Global Ocean Data Assimilation System", "description": "GODAS depends on continuous real-time data from the Global Ocean Observing System.

In order to exploit this new technique, GONG has developed a six-station network of extremely sensitive, and stable velocity imagers located around the Earth to obtain nearly continuous observations of the SUN's \"five-minute\" oscillations, or pulsations.\n\nThe site comprising the GONG Network are:\nBig Bear, California\nCerro Tololo, Chile\nLearmonth, Australia\nMauna Loa, Hawaii\nUdaipur, India\nObservatorio del Teide, Canary Islands\n\nThe five-minute oscillation is a subtle effect. Individual modes may exhibit velocities of less than 0.2 meters/second, while the sum of all of the modes is only a few hundred meters/second. The ultimate intention is to have the measurements be limited by the Sun's ``random'' surface motions. This means developing six stable instruments capable of making imaged velocity measurements with a precision of significantly less than one meter/second - one part in ten million! A low technological risk instrument based on a Michelson interferometer was selected, and it will be supported by a highly automated, portable installation, somewhat reminiscent of a spacecraft experiment.\n\nEach station in the network will produce more than 200 megabytes of data every day. Over the three year observing run, the raw data will exceed one terabyte, and the various processed data sets will exceed this several-fold. To keep up with the data flow, a pipe-line capable of roughly 6 Megaflops has be established to do the bulk processing and provide subsets of the data for the scientific community. Because of the widespread scientific participation, distributed data, software and analysis tools will be provided. Thus, in addition to a central facility, participating scientists will have access to readily transportable data archives and software, as well as shared analysis programs at their home institutions.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: GONG NETWORK\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: In Situ Land-based Platforms\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: SOLAR/SPACE MONITORING STATIONS\n      Short_Name: GONG NETWORK\n      Long_Name: Global Oscillation Network Group\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: GONG\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: INTERFEROMETERS\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-12-10\n   Online_Resource: http://gong.nso.edu/info/\n   Sample_Image: http://gong.nso.edu/instrument/outside_shelter.jpg\nEnd_Group"}, "ACE (DECADAL SURVEY)": {"short_name": "ACE (DECADAL SURVEY)", "long_name": "Aerosol - Cloud - Ecosystems", "description": "[Source: NASA Earth Science Decadal Survey Studies home page, http://decadal.gsfc.nasa.gov/ace.html ]\n\nMission objectives:\n\n    * Cloud and aerosol height\n    * Organic material in surface ocean layers\n    * Aerosol and cloud types and properties\n    * Improved climate models\n    * Prediction of local climate change\n    * Measure ocean productivity and health\n    * Air-quality models and forecasts\n\nACE is a tier 2 Decadal Survey mission focusing on clouds and aerosols as well as ocean ecosystem.

Hard-to-measure properties of high-level cirrus clouds that may affect global warming were recorded using specially designed instruments while the Altus flew at 50,000 feet altitude off the Hawaiian island of Kaua'i. Clouds both reflect incoming solar energy back to space, and absorb warm longwave radiation from the Earth's surface, keeping that heat in the atmosphere. Data from the study will help scientists better understand how these dual roles of clouds in reflecting and absorbing solar energy work, and build more accurate global climate models.\n\nIn September, 2001, ALTUS II served as the UAV platform for a flight demonstration of remote sensoring and imaging capabilities that could detect hot spots in wildfires and relay that data in near- real time via the Internet to firefighting commanders below. The demonstration, led by NASA Ames Research Center, was flown over GA-ASI's El Mirage development facility in Southern California.\n\nIn the summer of 2002, The Altus II served as the airborne platform for the Altus Cumulus Electrification Study (ACES), led by Dr. Richard Blakeslee of NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. The ACES experiment focused on the collection of electrical, magnetic and optical measurements of thunderstorms. Data collected will help scientists understand the development and life cycles of thunderstorms, which in turn may allow meteorologists to more accurately predict when destructive storms may hit.

In January 2006, the commercial imaging company GeoEye was formed, made up of former Orbimage of Dulles VA, and of former Space Imaging of Thornton, CO (Orbimage acquired Space Imaging in 2005 and gave the merged company the new name of GeoEye). The newly formed GeoEye company is the world's largest commercial satellite imagery provider.\n\nOn Sept. 30, 2004, OrbImage was awarded a NextView vendor contract of NGA (National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency). The contract, referred to as NextView OrbImage, provides long-term revenue commitments as well as capital for the development of OrbView-5. NGA's NextView program is designed to give US commercial imaging satellite operators the financing to build their satellites for high-resolution imaging.\n\nGeoEye's principal partners for the development and launch of the GeoEye-1 satellite include General Dynamics (formerly Spectrum Astro), ITT Industries (imager), and Boeing Launch Services. GeoEye's partners for the ground segment include IBM and MDA (MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates) of Richmond, BC, Canada.\n\nhe GeoEye-1 spacecraft is being designed and developed at General Dynamics/C4 Systems of Gilbert, AZ (formerly Spectrum Astro) as prime contractor. The contract was award in Dec. 2004. The spacecraft design is based on the SA-200HP standard modular bus (of Coriolis and SWIFT heritage). The spacecraft is 3-axis stabilized with a sophisticated attitude control system to provide a highly stable, while also highly agile imaging platform.\n\nA body-pointing capability of up to \u00b1 60\u00ba is being provided, made possible by enhanced reaction wheels (low jitter). The image geolocation accuracy is \u2264 3 m. The spacecraft mass is 1955 kg (bus mass = 1260 kg), the S/C design is fully redundant with an operational life of 7 years (the expected life is 10 years).\n\nOrbit: Sun-synchronous circular orbit, altitude = 684 km, inclination = 98\u00ba, period = 98 minutes, local equatorial crossing at 10:30 hours, effective revisit time capability \u2264 3 days.\n\nLaunch: A launch of GeoEye-1 is scheduled for August 2008 on a Delta-2 (7420-10) vehicle from VAFB, CA. The launch provider is ULA (United Launch Alliance). The launch delay from the fall of 2007 is due to a launch congestion at VAFB.\n\nRF communications: The source data are being stored on solid-state onboard recorders of 1.2 Tbit capacity. The downlink of imagery in X-band at 740 Mbit/s (or at 150 Mbit/s), the TT&C data are in S-band. The S/C is being operated from the command and control facility at GeoEye headquarters in Dulles, VA, along with an imagery acquisition station. Three other acquisition stations will be operated or leased by GeoEye in Barrow, AK, Troms\u00f8, Norway and Troll, Antarctica (the TrollSat station is located at 72\u00ba S and 2\u00ba E). The latter two stations are being leased from KSAT (Kongsberg Satellite Services) of Troms\u00f8, Norway.\nA total of four stations are needed to handle primary data reception due to the large volume of data that will be captured by the satellite. In addition, GeoEye will continue to support a network of receiving stations owned and operated by local business partners, referred to as Regional Affiliates and Regional Distributors.\n\nGround segment: GeoEye has built a fully integrated receiving, processing, and distribution network for delivering high-quality imagery products to customers around the world.\n\nIn late 2006, GeoEye purchased high-bandwidth, high-performance compute technology from SGI (Silicon Graphics Inc.). Four SGI Altix systems were installed at the Dulles (VA) ground station for data processing, distribution, and archiving services.\n\nSensor complement: (GIS)\n\nThe requirements of GeoEye-1 call for panchromatic imagery with a resolution of 0.41 m and multispectral imagery with a resolution of 1.64 m. The imager is being designed and developed by ITT Space Systems Division, formerly Kodak Remote Sensing Systems of Rochester, New York, which built also the sensor for Ikonos-2 (launch April 27, 1999). In January 2007, the GeoEye-1 imager system was delivered to General Dynamics for integration into the spacecraft.\n\nGIS (GeoEye Imager System). GIS is a pushbroom imaging system whose basic elements are the optics subsystem (telescope assembly), the focal plane assembly (CCD detector), and the digital electronics subsystem. The optics subsystem employs a TMA (Three Mirror Anastigmatic) telescope design with a primary mirror aperture of 1.1 m in diameter. Three mirrors are used to image and focus the light, and two additional mirrors to direct the image to the FPA (Focal Plane Assembly). The telescope is designed to give a near-perfect (diffraction limited) image to the FPA and to convert the analog pixels into digitized signals.\n\nThe FPA consists of an array of CCD detectors with 8 \u00b5m pixel size for PAN and 32 \u00b5m pixel size for multispectral imagery. ITT has included an outer barrel and door assembly to help protect the telescope and maintain its thermal environment.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: GEOEYE-1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: GEOEYE-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: ORBVIEW-5\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: CCD IMAGER\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 684 km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 98 degrees \n      Equator_Crossing: 10:30 AM\n      Period: 98 minutes\n      Repeat_Cycle: 3 days\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-06-27\n   Online_Resource: http://launch.geoeye.com/LaunchSite/about/fact_sheet.aspx\n   Online_Resource: http://directory.eoportal.org/get_announce.php?an_id=13708\n   Sample_Image: http://launch.geoeye.com/LaunchSite/assets/images/about/satellite.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2008-08-22\n      Design_Life: 10 YEARS\n      Primary_Sponsor: US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "HU-25C": {"short_name": "HU-25C", "long_name": "Dassault HU-25C Guardian"}, "ECMWFIFS": {"short_name": "ECMWFIFS", "long_name": "ECMWF Integrated Forecast System"}, "Nimbus-2": {"short_name": "Nimbus-2", "description": "Nimbus-2 was launched in May 1966 and was the second in a series of\nsecond-generation meteorological research-and-development satellites that was\ndesigned to serve as a stabilized, earth-oriented platform for the testing of\nadvanced meteorological sensor systems and for collecting meteorological data.\nThe polar-orbiting spacecraft consisted of three major elements: (1) a sensory\nring, (2) solar paddles, and (3) the control system housing. The solar paddles\nand the control system housing were connected to the sensory ring by a truss\nstructure, giving the satellite the appearance of an ocean buoy. Nimbus-2 was\nnearly 3.7 m tall, 1.5 m in diameter at the base, and about 3 m across with\nsolar paddles extended. The sensory ring, which formed the satellite base,\nhoused the electronics equipment and battery modules. The lower surface of the\ntorus-shaped sensory ring provided mounting space for sensors and telemetry\nantennas. An H-frame structure mounted within the center of the torus provided\nsupport for the larger experiments and tape recorders. Mounted on the control\nsystem housing, which was located on top of the spacecraft, were sun sensors,\nhorizon scanners, gas nozzles for attitude control, and a command antenna. Use\nof a stabilization and control system permitted the spacecraft's orientation to\nbe controlled to within plus or minus 1 degree for all three axes (pitch, roll,\nand yaw).\nThe spacecraft carried an advanced vidicon camera system for recording and\nstoring remote cloudcover pictures, an automatic picture transmission camera\nfor providing real-time cloudcover pictures, and both high- and\nmedium-resolution infrared radiometers (HRIR and MRIR) for measuring the\nintensity and distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted by and\nreflected from the earth and its atmosphere. The spacecraft and experiments\nperformed normally after launch until July 26, 1966, when the spacecraft tape\nrecorder failed. Its function was taken over by the HRIR tape recorder until\nNovember 15, 1966, when it also failed. Some real-time data were collected\nuntil January 17, 1969, when the spacecraft mission was terminated owing to\ndeterioration of the horizon scanner used for earth reference.\n__________\nTaken from the NSSDC System for Information Retrieval and Storage (SIRS).

The GOES-NEXT series is a joint effort on the part of NASA and NOAA to provide continued operational monitoring of weather systems primarily over the United States, distribute meteorological data to regional and national weather offices within the USA, contribute to the development of an environmental data collection network, contribute to the search and rescue program, improve the capability for forcasting and provide real-time warnings of solar distrubances, and to extend knowledge and understanding of atmospheric processes to improve short and long-term weather forecasts.\n\nThe GOES-NEXT series extends the capabilities of the previous GOES 1-7 spacecraft. The GOES I-M spacecraft will be placed over the equator at 135 deg West or 75 deg West. The design allows unobstructed views of the Earth for operational coverage by the spacecraft sensors. The spacecraft configuration is a compact box-shaped main body that carries the Earth-observing instruments, a continuous-drive solar array attached to the south panel through a yoke assembly, and a solar pointing instrument gimbal mounted on the solar panel yoke. The main body accomodates the sensors, electronics, and support subsystems. The communication antennas, except the Tracking, Telemetry, and Command (TT&C) antenna, are hard-mounted to the Earth-facing panel. The Propulsion Module consists of the fuel and oxidizer tanks for the bipropellant propulsion subsystem mounted on the central cylinder. The Attitude and Orbit Control Substem (AOCS) provides attitude control of the spacecraft. The AOCS consists of the sensors, electronics, and the actuators. The GOES power is generated from the solar array and two 12 A-hr batteries. Power is automatically regulated during solar eclipses. A conical shaped solar sail at the end of a 58-foot boom balances torque caused by solar radiation. The main body of the spacecraft is a 2-meter cube. In its deployed orbit configuration, the overall length is about 27 meters. Initial mass was about 4640 pounds, including fuel. Design lifetime is about five years.\n\nThe Image Navigation/Registration (INR) system provides Imager and Sounder data products in real-time to users. The Communications, Command, and Data Handling subsystem is comprised of antennas, receivers, transponders, transmitters, data encoders and encryptors and multiplexers. The Tracking Telemetry and Command (TT&C) subsystem provides the necessary monitor and command link between the spacecraft and the ground stations.\n\nThe GOES-NEXT instruments consist of the following: (1) Earth Imaging System, a 5-channel visible and infrared radiometer which provides Earth imagery 24 hours a day; (2) Sounding System, a 19-channel discrete-filter radiometer for obtaining atmospheric temperature and moisture soundings; (3) a Space Environment Monitor (SEM), which consists of a magnetic field sensor, a solar X-ray sensor, an energetic particle sensor (EPS), and a High Energy Proton and Alpha Detector (HEPAD); (4) a Search and Rescue subsystem (SARSAT), which receives signals from 406 MHz distress beacons and relays them to the ground; (5) a Data Collection System (DCS) for collecting and relaying real-time information from Data Collection Platforms (DCPs) such as buoys, balloons, remote weather stations, ships, and aircraft; and (6) a Weather Facsimile (WEFAX) system which relays processed weather imagary from the Wallops Island station to the user community.

Spin axis control is achieved by a chargeable permanent magnet system which is operated upon command and reacts with the earth's field to produce precession of several degrees per minute. With this system the spin axis was kept within 10 degrees of the orbit normal for several weeks at a time, although larger deviations have been tolerated. The spin rate was observed to decay at 0.05 rpm per day. Periodic use of the spin rate control system has compensated for spin decay.

The SRL payload, which first flew during STS-59 in April 1994, will again give scientists highly detailed information that will help them distinguish between human-induced environmental changes and other natural forms of change.\n\nSRL-2 will take radar images of the Earth's surface for Earth system sciences studies, including geology, geography, hydrology, oceanography, agronomy and botany.\n\nThe SRL payload is comprised of the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR), and the Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellite (MAPS). The German Space Agency (DARA) and the Italian Space Agency (ASI) are providing the X-SAR instrument.\n\nThe imaging radar of the SIR-C/X-SAR instruments has the ability to make measurements over virtually any region at any time, regardless of weather or sunlight conditions. The radar waves can penetrate clouds, and under certain conditions, also can \"see\" through vegetation, ice and extremely dry sand. In many cases, radar is the only way scientists can explore inaccessible regions of the Earth's surface. \n\nThe SIR-C/X-SAR radar data provide information about how many of Earth's complex systems - those processes that control the movement of land, water, air and life - work together to make this a livable planet. The science team particularly wants to study the amount of vegetation coverage, the extent of snow packs, wetlands areas, geologic features such as rock types and their distribution, volcanic activity, ocean wave heights and wind speed. STS-68 will fly over the same sites that STS-59 observed so that scientists will be able to study seasonal changes that may have occurred in those areas between the missions.\n\nAn international team of 49 science investigators and three associates will conduct the SIR-C/X-SAR experiments. Thirteen nations are represented: Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and the United States.\n\nThe MAPS experiment will measure the global distribution of carbon monoxide in the troposphere, or lower atmosphere. Measurements of carbon monoxide, an important element in several chemical cycles, provide scientists with indications of how well the atmosphere can cleanse itself of \"greenhouse gases,\" chemicals that can increase the atmosphere's temperature.\n\nSTS-68 provided a continuation of NASA's Get Away Special (GAS) experiments program. The project gives a person or organization a chance to perform experiments in space on a Shuttle mission. Two universities, North Carolina A&T State University and University of Alabama in Huntsville, and the Swedish Space Corp., Soina, Sweden, will have small self-contained payloads flying during the STS-68 mission.

The GOES imaging and sounding instruments (built by ITT) feature flexible scans for small-scale area viewing in regions of the visible and infrared spectrum allowing meteorologists to improve short-term forecasts. GOES provides nearly continuous imaging and sounding, which allow forecasters to better measure changes in atmospheric temperature and moisture distributions and hence increase the accuracy of their forecasts. GOES environmental information is used for a host of applications, including weather monitoring and prediction models, ocean temperatures and moisture locations, climate studies, cryosphere (ice, snow, glaciers) detection and extent, land temperatures and crop conditions, and hazards detection. The GOES-O&P Imagers have improved resolution in the 13 micrometer channel from 8 km to 4 km. The finer spatial resolution allows an improved cloud-top product, height of atmospheric motion vectors and volcanic ash detection.

The cylindrically shaped spacecraft measured 190.5 cm in diameter and 230 cm in length, exclusive of a magnetometer that extended an additional 83 cm beyond the cylinder shell. The primary structural members were a honeycombed equipment shelf and thrust tube. The VISSR telescope was mounted on the equipment shelf and viewed the Earth through a special aperture in the side of the spacecraft. A support structure extended radially out from the thrust tube and was affixed to the solar panels, which formed the outer walls of the spacecraft and provided the primary source of electrical power. Located in the annulus-shaped space between the thrust tube and the solar panels were stationkeeping and dynamics control equipment, batteries, and most of the SEM equipment. Proper spacecraft attitude and spin rate (approximately 100 rpm) were maintained by two separate sets of jet thrusters mounted around the spacecraft equator and activated by ground command. The spacecraft used both UHF-band and S-band frequencies in its telemetry and command subsystem. A low-power VHF transponder provided telemetry and command during launch and then served as a backup for the primary subsystem once the spacecraft attained orbit. The spin-stabilized spacecraft carried a visible infrared spin-scan radiometer, meteorological data collection and transmission system, space environment monitor, and a biaxial fluxgate magnetometer. It operated at 135 degrees West as GOES-WEST.

The\nprimary objective was to provide global daytime and nighttime direct\nreadout real-time cloudcover data on a daily basis. The\nsun-synchronous spacecraft was also capable of supplying global\natmospheric temperature soundings and very high resolution infrared\ncloudcover data for selected areas in either a direct readout or a\ntape-recorder mode. A secondary objective was to obtain global\nsolar-proton flux data on a real-time daily basis. The sensors were\nmounted on the satellite baseplate with their optical axes directed\nvertically earthward. The nearly cubical spacecraft measured 1 by 1 by\n1.2 m. The satellite was equipped with three curved solar panels that\nwere folded during launch and deployed after orbit was achieved. Each\npanel measured over 4.2 m in length when unfolded and was covered with\napproximately 3500 solar cells measuring 2 by 2 cm. The dynamics and\nattitude control system maintained desired spacecraft orientation\nthrough gyroscopic principles incorporated into the satellite\ndesign. Earth orientation of the satellite body was maintained by\ntaking advantage of the precession induced from a momentum flywheel so\nthat the satellite body precession rate of one revolution per orbit\nprovided the desired 'earth-looking' attitude. Minor adjustments in\nattitude and orientation were made by means of magnetic coils and by\nvarying the speed of the momentum flywheel.\nThe primary sensors consisted of a Very High Resolution Radiometer\n(VHRR), Vertical Temperature Profile Radiometer (VTPR), and a Scanning\nRadiometer (SR).  The spacecraft was placed in a sun-synchronous orbit\nwith equatorial crossing of the ascending node near 8:30 a.m. local\ntime.\n__________\nTaken from the NSSDC System for Information Retrieval and Storage (SIRS).

The spaceship Atlantis has carried on the spirit  of the sailing vessel with several important voyages of its own,  including the Galileo planetary explorer mission in 1989 and the  deployment of the Arthur Holley Compton Gamma Ray Observatory in  1991.\n\nAtlantis benefited from lessons learned in the construction and  testing of Enterprise, Columbia and Challenger. At rollout, its  weight was some 6,974 pounds less than Columbia. The Experience  gained during the Orbiter assembly process also enabled  Atlantis to be completed with a 49.5 percent reduction in man  hours (compared to Columbia). Much of this decrease can be  attributed to the greater use of thermal protection blankets on  the upper orbiter body instead of tiles. During the  construction of Discovery and Atlantis, NASA opted to have the  various contractors manufacture a set of 'structural spares' to  facilitate the repair of an Orbiter if one was damaged during  an accident.

Two satellites, DE 1 and DE 2, were launched together and were placed in polar coplanar orbits, permitting simultaneous measurements at high and low altitudes in the same field-line region. The DE 1 spacecraft (high-altitude mission) uses an elliptical orbit selected to allow (1) measurements extending from the hot magnetospheric plasma through the plasmasphere to the cool ionosphere; (2) global auroral imaging, wave measurements in the heart of the magnetosphere, and crossing of auroral field lines at several earth radii; and (3) measurements for significant periods along a magnetic field flux tube. The spacecraft approximated a short polygon 137 cm in diameter and 115 cm high. The antennas in the X-Y plane measured 200-m tip-to-tip, and on the Z-axis are 9 meters tip-to-tip. Two six-meter booms are provided for remote measurements. Power is supplied by a solar cell array, mounted on the side and end panels. The spacecraft is spin stabilized, with the spin axis normal to the orbital plane, and the spin rate at ten plus or minus 0.1 rpm. A pulse code modulation (PCM) telemetry data system is used that operates in real time or in a tape-recorder mode. Data have been acquired on a science-problem-oriented basis, with closely coordinated operations of the various instruments, both satellites, and supportive experiments. Data acquired from the instruments are temporarily stored on tape recorders before transmission at an 8:1 playback-to-record ratio. Additional operational flexibility allows a playback-to-record ratio of 4:1. The primary data rate is 16,384 bits per second. Since commands are stored in a command memory unit, spacecraft operations are not real time, except for the transmission of the wideband analog data from the Plasma Wave Instrument (81-070A-02).

It flies in a circular orbit at an altitude of approximately 800 km (500 miles) above Earth's surface. It completes a full orbit in about 101 minutes, which translates to a little more than 14 orbits per day.\n\nSeaWinds is the main instrument on the QuikSCAT satellite. SeaWinds is an active radar scatterometer. This scatterometer operates by transmitting high-frequency microwave pulses to the ocean surface and measuring the echoed radar pulses bounced back to the satellite. The scatterometer estimates wind speed and direction over the Earth's oceans at 10 m above the surface of the water. The instrument collects data over ocean, land, and ice in a continuous, 1,800-kilometer-wide band, making approximately 400,000 measurements and covering 90% of Earth's surface in one day. QuikSCAT can acquire hundreds of times more observations of surface wind velocity each day than can ships and buoys, and can provide continuous, accurate and high-resolution measurements of both wind speeds and direction regardless of weather conditions. This data is vital for global climate research, operational weather forecasting, and storm warning.\n\nThe SeaWinds scatterometer is providing unprecedented, frequent surface wind speed and direction measurements over the global oceans. Coupled with other satellite measurements of cloud patterns, water vapor and rain, the data are contributing to scientists' ability to predict the intensity, location and movements of hurricanes and other severe marine weather patterns.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: QUIKSCAT\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: QUIKSCAT\n      Long_Name: Quick Recovery Scatterometer\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: QUIKSCAT\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: SEAWINDS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 803 km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 98.6 degrees\n      Equator_Crossing: 6:00 p.m.\n      Period: 101 minutes\n      Perigee: 804 km (499 mi)\n      Apogee: 806 km (500 mi)\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-04-16\n   Online_Resource: http://winds.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/quikscat/index.cfm\n   Online_Resource: http://nasascience.nasa.gov/missions/quikscat\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1999-06-19\n      Launch_Site: Vandenberg Air Force Base, USA\n      Design_Life: 3 years (exceeded)\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "TIMED": {"short_name": "TIMED", "long_name": "Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics", "description": "NASA's Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED)\nspacecraft was launched on December 7, 2001 from Vandenberg AFB.

The spaceship Columbia has continued the pioneering legacy of its forebears, becoming the first Space Shuttle to fly into Earth orbit in 1981. Four sister ships joined the fleet over the next 10 years: Challenger, arriving in 1982 but destroyed four years later; Discovery, 1983; Atlantis, 1985; and Endeavour, built as a replacement for Challenger, 1991. A test vehicle, the Enterprise, was used for suborbital approach and landing tests and did not fly in space.\n\nColumbia was the first on-line orbiter to undergo the scheduled inspection and retrofit program. It was transported August 10, 1991, after its completion of mission STS-40, to prime Shuttle contractor Rockwell International's Palmdale, California assembly plant. The oldest orbiter in the fleet underwent approximately 50 modifications, including the addition of carbon brakes, drag chute, improved nose wheel steering, removal of development flight instrumentation and an enhancement of its thermal protection system. The orbiter returned to KSC February 9, 1992 to begin processing for mission STS-50 in June of that year.\n\nOn October 8, 1994, Columbia was transported to Palmdale California for its first ODMP. Approximately 90 modifications and upgrades were made to Columbia during this 6 month period. Modifications included upgrades to the main landing gear thermal barrier, tire pressure monitoring system and radiator drive circuitry. (Reference KSC Press Release 113-94 and Shuttle Status Report 10/10/94)\n\nOn September 24, 1999, Columbia was transported to Palmdale California for its second ODMP. While in California, workers will perform more than 100 modifications on the vehicle. Columbia will be the second orbiter outfitted with the multi-functional electronic display system (MEDS) or \"glass cockpit\". Last year, Shuttle Atlantis had the full-color, flat-panel displays installed on its flight deck during an OMDP. The new system improves crew interaction with the orbiter during flight and reduces the high cost of maintaining the outdated electromechanical cockpit displays currently onboard. (Reference KSC Press Release 74-99).\n\nOn February 1, 2003, Columbia was lost during re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. \n\n[Summary provided by NASA]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: OV-102\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Space Stations/Manned Spacecraft\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: SPACE SHUTTLE\n      Short_Name: OV-102\n      Long_Name: Columbia Space Shuttle\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: Columbia\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-01-24\n   Online_Resource: http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/resources/orbiters/columbia.html\n   Sample_Image: http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/resources/orbiters/columbia-logo.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS)": {"short_name": "Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS)"}, "LEARJET": {"short_name": "LEARJET", "description": "The Learjet started life as an abortive Swiss ground-attack fighter aircraft, the FFA P-16.

This was reversed soon after due to a crash of the third prototype. Two additional prototypes were finished, the last in 1960, but the project was ended at this point.\n\nThe basic structure of this aircraft was seen by Bill Lear and his team as a good starting point to the development of a business jet, which was originally intended to be called the SAAC-23. The wing with its distinctive tip fuel tanks and landing gear of the first Learjets were little changed from those used by the fighter prototypes. The tooling for building the aircraft was purchased and moved to Wichita, Kansas in 1962. On February 7, assembly of the first Learjet began.

When there are no disasters, AlSAT-1 will be used for Algerian purposes such as monitoring desertification, industrial and marine pollution, agricultural monitoring, geophysics mapping and fire detection. The nature of the mission is that the 6 micro-satellites, when coordinated together, can produce a daily revisit with a 32 m resolution multi-spectral imaging and 600 km ground track. AlSAT-1 uses the flight proven modular SSTL bus from previous missions but will carry a push broom imager for the first time on SSTL micro-satellites. As a part of the constellation and to maintain a daily coverage, AlSAT-1 is equipped with a propulsion system for orbit corrections.\n\nAlSAT-1's main payload a multi-spectral earth observation imager. Digital store and forward communications can be experienced between two points and autonomous GPS positioning techniques also accomplished.\n\nThe Algerian satellite is one of SSTL\u0092s new generation microsatellites in a sense that it carries a new type of push broom sensors. These types of sensors can previously only be found in larger commercial satellites. Because of the advance in electronics and semiconductor integration on a single chip, nowadays these sensors are being implemented by SSTL on microsatellites.\n\nAlSAT-1 is designed to view the earth surface with a 32 m resolution in three spectral bands (R, G, NIR) and a ground track of 600 km. The spectral bands were chosen to correspond to those used by commercial satellites in the following wavelengths (in micrometer) 0.5-0.6 micrometer, 0.6-0.7 , 0.7-0.8 ). The imaging system comprises two cameras for each spectral band and two sensors with 10 000 pixels each. This represents a huge quantity of data for the electronics on board (processors, SSDR, fast clocks) to deal with.\n\nThe cameras provide 32 m ground resolution in 3 spectral bands capable of giving detailed information on earth resources, land use and effects of pollution and natural disasters using 2x10 000 pixels linear array detectors digitized to 8 bits radiometric resolution (256 levels). The image swath width is 600 km and the imager can collect images continuously along the flight track. The images are stored on board the microsatellite via the On Board Computer (OBC) and Controller Area Network (CAN) in the 2x512 Mbytes Solid State Data Recorder (SSDR) for later transmission to ground via digital packet error controlled links at 8 Mbit/s in S-band.\n\nHowever, on the satellite there will be an option to do \u0093windowing\u0094.

This program, previously known as DAPP (Data Acquisition and Processing Program), was classified until March 1973. The objective of this program is to provide global visual and infrared cloudcover data and specialized environmental data to support Department of Defense operational weather analysis and forecasting requirements. Operationally, the program consists of two satellites in sun-synchronous polar orbits, with the ascending node of one satellite in early morning and the other at local noon.\n\nThe 6.4-m-long spacecraft is separated into four sections: (1) a precision mounting platform for sensors and equipment requiring precise alignment; (2) an equipment support module containing the electronics, reaction wheels, and some meteorological sensors; (3) a reaction control equipment support structure containing the third-stage rocket motor and supporting the ascent phase reaction control equipment; and (4) a 9.29-sq-m solar cell panel. The spacecraft stabilization is controlled by a combination flywheel and magnetic control coil system so that sensors are maintained in the desired earth-looking mode. One feature is the precision-pointing accuracy of the primary imager to 0.01 deg provided by a star sensor and an updated ephemeris navigation system. This allows automatic geographical mapping of the digital imagery to the nearest picture element.\n\nThe operational linescan system is the primary data acquisition system and provides real-time or stored, multi-orbit, day-and-night, visual and infrared imagery of clouds. A supplementary sensor package contains: (1) a microwave imager; (2) a microwave temperature sounder; (3) a microwave water vapor profiler; (4) an ion and electron scintillation monitor; (5) a precipitating electron/ion spectrometer; (6) a gamma/X-ray detector, and (7) a magnetometer.\n\nData are transmitted to ground receiving sites by two redundant S-band transmitters. Real-time data are received at tactical sites world-wide. Recorded data are transmitted to and processed by the Air Force Global Weather Central (AFGWC), Offutt AFB, Nebraska, and the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FNMOC), Monterey, California. Both AFGWC and FNMOC relay the SSM/I, SSM/T, and SSM/T2 data to the National Environmental Satellite Data and Information System (NESDIS). AFGWC also sends the entire data stream to the National Geophysical Data Center, Boulder, Colorado. Additional information concerning can be found in the report by D. A.

The\nprimary objective was to provide global daytime and nighttime direct\nreadout real-time cloudcover data on a daily basis. The\nsun-synchronous spacecraft was also capable of supplying global\natmospheric temperature soundings and very high resolution infrared\ncloudcover data for selected areas in either a direct readout or a\ntape-recorder mode. A secondary objective was to obtain global\nsolar-proton flux data on a real-time daily basis. The sensors were\nmounted on the satellite baseplate with their optical axes directed\nvertically earthward. The nearly cubical spacecraft measured 1 by 1 by\n1.2 m. The satellite was equipped with three curved solar panels that\nwere folded during launch and deployed after orbit was achieved. Each\npanel measured over 4.2 m in length when unfolded and was covered with\napproximately 3500 solar cells measuring 2 by 2 cm. The dynamics and\nattitude control system maintained desired spacecraft orientation\nthrough gyroscopic principles incorporated into the satellite\ndesign. Earth orientation of the satellite body was maintained by\ntaking advantage of the precession induced from a momentum flywheel so\nthat the satellite body precession rate of one revolution per orbit\nprovided the desired 'earth-looking' attitude. Minor adjustments in\nattitude and orientation were made by means of magnetic coils and by\nvarying the speed of the momentum flywheel.\nThe primary sensors consisted of a Very High Resolution Radiometer\n(VHRR), Vertical Temperature Profile Radiometer (VTPR), and a Scanning\nRadiometer (SR).  The spacecraft became the operational ITOS\nspacecraft on March 19, 1974.  Operations terminated in August 1976.\n__________\nTaken from the NSSDC System for Information Retrieval and Storage\n(SIRS).

The experimental payload included one ion and two neutral mass spectrometers, three magnetron density gauges, and two electrostatic probes.  Additional equipment included optical and magnetic aspect sensors, magnetic attitude and spin rate control systems, and a tape recorder for data acquisition at locations remote from ground receiving stations.  Power was supplied by silver-zinc batteries and a solar cell array mounted on the satellite exterior.  Two identical pulse-modulated telemetry systems and a canted turnstile antenna were employed.  The two neutral-particle mass spectrometers failed about 6 days after launch. The remaining experiments operated satisfactorily and provided useful data for most of the 10-month satellite lifetime.

This program, previously known as DAAP (Data Acquisition and Processing Program), was classified until March 1973. The objectives of this program are to provide global visual and infrared cloud-cover data and specialized environmental data to support Department of Defense requirements. Operationally, the program consisted of two satellites in planned 830-km sun-synchronous polar orbits, with the ascending node of one satellite in early morning and the other at local noon. The 5.4-m long spacecraft was separated into four sections: (1) a precision mounting platform (PMP) for sensors and equipment requiring precise alignment, (2) an equipment support module (ESM) containing the electronics, reaction wheels, and some meteorological sensors, (3) a reaction control equipment (RCE) support structure (including the third-stage motor, hydrazine reaction control system) that supported (4) a 9.29 sq m solar cell panel. The spacecraft stabilization was controlled by a combination flywheel and magnetic control coil system, so that sensors were maintained in the desired 'earth-looking' mode. One feature was the precision-pointing accuracy of the primary imager to 0.01 deg provided by a star sensor and an updated ephemeris navigation system. This allowed automatic geographical mapping of the digital imagery to the nearest picture element. The operational line scan system (OLS) built by Westinghouse, was the primary data acquisition system that provided real-time or stored, multi-orbit, day-and-night visual and infrared imagery at 1/3 nautical mile resolution for all major land masses, 1-1/2 nautical mile resolution for complete global coverage, and provided with this data calibration, timing, and other auxiliary signals to the spacecraft for digital transmission to the ground. A supplementary sensor package, the special sensor H (SSH), a step-scanning radiometer, was the infrared temperature-humidity-ozone sounder. The data processing system, which included three high-density tape recorders, was capable of storing a total of 400 min of data, each allowing full global coverage twice daily. Either recorded or real-time data were transmitted to ground-receiving sites by two redundant S-band transmitters. Recorded data were read out to tracking sites located at Fairchild AFB, WA, and Loring AFB, ME, and relayed by SATCOM to Air Fource Global Weather Central, Offutt AFB, NE. Real-time data were read out at mobile tactical sites located around the world.

At present, the elevation models that are available for large parts of Earth are of low resolution, inconsistent or incomplete. In addition, they are commonly based on different data sources and survey methods. TanDEM-X, TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement, is designed to close these gaps and deliver a homogenous elevation model that should prove indispensable for many scientific and commercial applications. Orbiting Earth at an altitude of around 500 kilometres, the two nearly-identical radar satellites have begun mapping its surface.\n\nThe first of the two, TerraSAR-X, has been operating since 2007. Three years years on, it has been joined by its twin satellite, TanDEM-X. Flying in close formation only a few hundred metres apart, the two satellites are imaging the terrain below them simultaneously, from different angles. These images are processed into accurate elevation maps with a 12-metre resolution and a vertical accuracy better than 2 metres. The amount of data generated by the satellites will grow to 1.5 petabytes within three years, corresponding to a storage capacity of almost 200,000 DVDs. Like the TerraSAR-X mission, TanDEM-X is a project developed under a public-private partnership between the German Aerospace Center, DLR, and Astrium GmbH based in Friedrichshafen, Germany.\n\nThe TanDEM-X mission\n\nThe TanDEM-X mission will survey all 150 million square kilometres of Earth's land surface several times over during its three-year mission. Apart from its high measuring-point density (a 12-metre grid) and high vertical accuracy (better than two metres), the elevation model generated by TanDEM-X will have another unrivalled advantage \u2013 being entirely homogenous, it will serve as a basis for maps that are globally consistent. Conventional maps are often fragmented along national borders, or difficult to reconcile as they are based on different survey methods or because of time lags between survey campaigns.\n\nTogether TanDEM-X and TerraSAR-X are form the first configurable synthetic aperture radar interferometer in space. Besides this primary goal, the mission has several secondary objectives based on new and innovative methods such as along-track interferometry, polarimetric synthetic aperture radar interferometry, digital beamforming and bistatic radar. The TanDEM-X satellite follows the TerraSAR-X design with minor modifications such as an additional cold gas propulsion system (powered by high-pressure nitrogen gas) to enable fine-tuning of its relative position during formation flying and an additional S-band receiver to receive status and position information sent by TerraSAR-X. The TanDEM-X satellite has been designed for a nominal lifetime of five years and has a planned overlap with TerraSAR-X of three years. TerraSAR-X holds consumables and resources for up to seven years of operation however, potentially allowing for a prolongation of the overlap and the duration of the TanDEM-X mission"}, "SBAS": {"short_name": "SBAS", "long_name": "Satellite-Based Augmentation System Satellites", "description": "SBAS is a satellite-based augmentation system that supports wide-area or reginal augmentation through the use of additional satellite broadcast messages.

It was launched in early\n2002 from Japan by Japan's National Space Development Agency.\n\nThe purpose of FedSat is to:\n\nEstablish Australian capability in microsatellite technologies\nDevelop expertise necessary for sustaining those industries and\nprofiting from them\n\nTest and develop Australian-developed intellectual property\nProvide a research platform for Australian space science,\ncommunication and GPS studies.\n\nFedSat was developed by the Cooperative Research Centre for\nSatellite Systems, which combines the resources and skills of 12\nAustralian organizations. Contributions from each of the partner\norganizations are doubled by the Commonwealth Government, under\nits Commonwealth Government's Cooperative Research Center?s\nProgram. The total budget of the Centre is approximately\n&#3660 million over 7 years, with &#3620 million of that\nallocated for the FedSat mission. Much of FedSat was developed\nin Australia by the CRCSS. Three of the six main payloads have\nbeen fully developed by the CRCSS, and the other three have been\nsupplied by overseas organizations in consultation with the\nCRCSS.  The satellite platform, the structure that houses and\nmaintains the payloads, is being provided by overseas\norganizations. CRCSS engineers could have developed an\nAustralian platform, but given the time available from\nproject-start to launch, that was not practical. CRCSS opted to\ncontract an overseas platform supplier, avoiding the need to\nreinvent established technologies.  Payloads:\n\n1. GPS Receiver: The GPS, Global Positioning System, is an\nAmerican network of satellites that transmit radio signals\ncontaining time and orbit-position codes. GPS receivers decode\nthe signals, and by comparing signals of up to 4 satellites with\nknown positions, they can derive their own locations by\ntriangulation. The system was designed for mainly military use,\nbut now GPS provides many scientific and civilian applications.\n\n2. NewMag: The NewMag magnetometer is a very sensitive and\nrapid-sampling device for measuring the strength of the Earth's\nmagnetic field. Earth is like a big bar magnet, with magnetic\nfield lines emerging from the poles and far out into\nspace. FedSat's polar orbit crosses all these lines, so NewMag\ncan effectively gain a window into the whole magnetosphere\nregion. NewMag can also measure vibrations simultaneously with\nground- based magnetometers, so investigating the dynamics of\nthe magnetosphere (changes in it shape due to variations in the\nSun), and study magnetospheric wave-propagation.\n\n3. High performance computing: The FedSat high performance\ncomputing payload is the world's first use of reconfigurable\ncomputing technology in space. Reconfigurable computers permit\nchange of their physical circuits via software control; new\nphysical circuits can be installed into a reconfigurable\ncomputer module by remote command. For spacecraft, this\ntechnology means that satellites can be rewired without having\nto retrieve them.\n\n4. Ka-band transponder: The FedSat Ka-band transponder is\ndesigned to handle the new experimental high- frequency and\nhigh-capacity Ka part of the radio spectrum. The transponder\nprocesses signals to and from the ground in the frequency\nband. The transponder incorporates CRCSS-designed Gallium\nArsenide monolithic microwave circuits; FedSat will space\nqualify these for the first time.\n\n5. Baseband processor The baseband processor provides on-board\ncomputer processing of the Ka- and UHF- band payloads. It has\nbeen designed and built by the CRCSS, to operate as a low power\nsingle modem with flexible operation. It will also provide the\nchannel for satellite operations commands.\n\n6. UHF communications payload: The Ultra High Frequency band\npayload will introduce a new type of packet data service for Low\nEarth Orbiting satellites to obtain environmental data. For\nexample, ocean buoys may transmit their data using this means to\norbiting satellites, which are retransmitted back to the lab for\nanalysis.\n\n7. CD ROM: FedSat also carries a compact disc mounted on the\nside, containing the audio messages members of the Australian\npublic recorded to go into space from March to August 2000. The\ndisc also contains a copy of the song From Little Things, Big\nThings Grow, by Paul Kelly, with kind permission of the writers\n(Kev Carmody/Paul Kelly) and publishers (Larrikin Music,\nMushroon Records).\n\nAdditional information available at\n\"http://www.crcss.csiro.au/overview.htm\"\nand\n\"http://www.crcss.csiro.au/launch/launch.html\"\n\n[Summary provided by CSIRO]"}, "GEOS-3": {"short_name": "GEOS-3", "long_name": "Geodetic Earth Orbiting Satellite-3", "description": "The mission of GEOS 3 (Geodynamics Experimental Ocean Satellite) was to provide\nthe stepping stone between the National Geodetic Satellite Program (NGSP) and\nthe Earth and Ocean Physics Application Program.

Earth's ionosphere reacts to the intense x-ray and ultraviolet radiation released during a solar flare. The ionospheric disturbance enhances VLF radio propagation. By monitoring the signal strength of a distant VLF transmitter, sudden ionospheric disturbances (SIDs) are recorded and indicate a recent solar flare event.\n\nAll SID monitoring stations are homebuilt by the observers. Instructions for constructing the VLF receiver and antenna can be obtained from the AAVSO Solar Division chairman. The receiver design has progressed remarkably as the SID program participants have been inspired to improve signal sensitivity and noise rejection. Recent SID station receivers follow a design developed by SID Technical Coordinator Art Stokes. The Stokes Gyrator receiver can be built and tuned by anyone with simple soldering skills. A small indoor loop antenna captures the radio wave for amplification and rectification by the receiver. The SID station operates unattended until the end of each month. Recordings are then analyzed for the beginning, end, and duration of SID events.\n\nMore info available at\nhttp://www.aavso.org/committees/solar/sid.stm\n\n[Source: AAVSO]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: SID\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: In Situ Land-based Platforms\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: SOLAR/SPACE MONITORING STATIONS\n      Short_Name: SID\n      Long_Name: Sudden Ionospheric Disturbance Stations\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: SID\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-12-10\n   Online_Resource: http://www.aavso.org/committees/solar/sid.stm\nEnd_Group"}, "SPAS-II": {"short_name": "SPAS-II", "long_name": "Shuttle Pallet Satellite-II", "description": "The SPAS (Shuttle Pallet Satellite) satellite was a reusable free-flying vehicle built by Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm.which could be deployed and then retrieved by the US Space Shuttle's Remote Manipulator System arm.

The cylindrically shaped spacecraft measured 190.5 cm in diameter and 230 cm in length, exclusive of a magnetometer that extended an additional 83 cm beyond the cylinder shell. The primary structural members were a honeycombed equipment shelf and thrust tube.  The VISSR telescope was mounted on the equipment shelf and viewed the Earth through a special aperture in the side of the spacecraft.  A support structure extended radially out from the thrust tube and was affixed to the solar panels, which formed the outer walls of the spacecraft and provided the primary source of electrical power.  Located in the annulus-shaped space between the thrust tube and the solar panels were stationkeeping and dynamics control equipment, batteries, and most of the SEM equipment.  Proper spacecraft attitude and spin rate (approximately 100 rpm) were maintained by two separate sets of jet thrusters mounted around the spacecraft equator and activated by ground command.  The spacecraft used both UHF-band and S-band frequencies in its telemetry and command subsystem.  A low-power VHF transponder provided telemetry and command during launch and then served as a backup for the primary subsystem once the spacecraft attained orbit.\n\nThe spin-stabilized spacecraft carried a visible infrared spin-scan radiometer atmospheric sounder, meteorological data collection and transmission system, space environment monitor, and a biaxial fluxgate magnetometer.  It operated at 100 degrees West initially, but replaced GOES 3 at 135 degrees West in March 1981.  When GOES 5 VAS experienced a failure on July 30, 1984, GOES 4 was reactivated by NOAA to provide GOES 1 VISSR data relay services to western users.\n\nMore information about GOES Satellites:\nhttp://www.oso.noaa.gov/goes/\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: GOES-4\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite)\n      Short_Name: GOES-4\n      Long_Name: Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 4\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: GOES D\n      Short_Name: 11964\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: SXM\n      Short_Name: VAS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Type: GEO > Geosynchronous > Geostationary\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-10-04\n   Online_Resource: http://www.oso.noaa.gov/goes/\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1980-074A\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1980-09-09\n      Launch_Site: CAPE CANAVERAL/KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NOAA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "OrbView-1": {"short_name": "OrbView-1", "long_name": "OSC Microlab-1 Satellite", "description": "MicroLab 1, also known as OrbView 1 was launched on April 3,\n1995, OrbView-1 provides the world's first broad-area\ncloud-to-cloud lightning data.\n\nOrbView-1's payload consists of two sensors:\n\n-an Optical Transient Detector (OTD) provided by NASA's Marshall\nSpace Flight Center, and\n\n-an atmospheric monitoring instrument (GPS/MET) sponsored by the\nNational Science Foundation and the University Consortium for\nAtmospheric Research.\n\nThe OTD sensor maps atmospheric lighting strikes and has\nprovided NASA with information important to the understanding of\nsevere weather patterns.

The spacecraft spin axis was perpendicular to the\necliptic plane with a spin rate of 5 rpm, giving it a spin period of\n12 seconds.  IMP-6 continued the study, begun by earlier IMPs, of the\ninterplanetary and outer magnetospheric regions by measuring energetic\nparticles, plasma, and electric and magnetic fields.  A radio astronomy\nexperiment was also included in the spacecraft payload.  The initial\napogee point was near the earth-sun line.  The solar-cell and chemical-\nbattery powered spacecraft carried two transmitters.  One continuously\ntransmitted PCM encoder data at a 1600-bps information bit rate.  The\nsecond transmitter was used for transmission of VLF data and for ranging\ninformation.  Three orthogonal pairs of dipole antennas were used for\nthe electric fields experiments, and one of these pairs was also used\nfor the radio astronomy experiment.  The members of the antenna pair\nalong the spacecraft spin axis extended 2.9 meter, the members of the\nantennal pair used in both the electric field and radio astronomy\nexperiments extended 45.5 meter, and the members of the third pair were\nslightly unbalanced, extending 24.4 meter and 27.6 meter, respectively.\nAll four elements perpendicular to the spin axis were to have extended\n45.5 meter.  The spacecraft reentered the earth's atmosphere on October 2,\n1974, after a highly successful mission.

After safe passage through the Asteroid\nbelt on 19 April 1974, the Pioneer 11 thrusters were fired to add another 63.7\nm/sec (210 ft/sec) to the spacecraft's velocity. This adjusted the aiming point\nat Jupiter to 43,000 km (26,725 miles) above the cloudtops. The close approach\nalso allowed the spacecraft to be accelerated by Jupiter to a velocity 55 times\nthat of the muzzle velocity of a high speed rifle bullet - 173,000 km/hr\n(108,000 mph) - so that it would be carried across the Solar System some 2.4\nbillion kilometers (1.5 billion miles) to Saturn.\n\nDuring its flyby of Jupiter on 2 December 1974, Pioneer 11 obtained dramatic\nimages of the Great Red Spot, made the first observation of the immense polar\nregions, and determined the mass of Jupiter's moon, Callisto.\n\nLooping high above the ecliptic plane and across the Solar System, Pioneer 11\nraced toward its appointment with Saturn on 1 September 1979. Pioneer 11 flew\nto within 13,000 miles of Saturn and took the first close-up pictures of the\nplanet. Instruments located two previously undiscovered small moons and an\nadditional ring, charted Saturn's magnetosphere and magnetic field and found\nits planet-size moon, Titan, to be too cold for life. Hurtling underneath the\nring plane, Pioneer 11 sent back amazing pictures of Saturn's rings. The rings,\nwhich normally seem bright when observed from Earth, appeared dark in the\nPioneer pictures, and the dark gaps in the rings seen from Earth appeared as\nbright rings.\n\nFollowing its encounter with Saturn, Pioneer 11 explored the outer regions of\nour Solar system, studying energetic particles from our Sun (Solar Wind) and\ncosmic rays entering our portion of the Milky Way. In September 1995, Pioneer\n11 was at a distance of 6.5 billion km (4 billion miles) from Earth. At that\ndistance, it takes over 6 hours for the radio signal (which is traveling at the\nspeed of light) to reach Earth. However, by September 1995, Pioneer 11 could no\nlonger make any scientific observations. On 30 September 1995, routine daily\nmission operations were stopped. Intermittent contact continued until November\n1995, at which time the last communication with Pioneer 11 took place. There\nhave been no communications with Pioneer 11 since. The Earth's motion has\ncarried it out of the view of the spacecraft antenna. The spacecraft cannot be\nmaneuvered to point back at the Earth. It is not known whether the spacecraft\nis still transmitting a signal. No further tracks of Pioneer 11 are scheduled. \n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: PIONEER 11\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Interplanetary Spacecraft\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: FLYBY\n      Short_Name: PIONEER 11\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: Pioneer-G\n      Short_Name: 06421\n      Short_Name: 1973-019A\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-02-05\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1973-019A\n   Sample_Image: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/image/spacecraft/pioneer10-11.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1973-04-05\n      Launch_Site: Cape Canaveral/Kennedy Space Center, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA/Ames\n      Primary_Sponsor: TRW\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "TIPS": {"short_name": "TIPS", "long_name": "Tether Physics and Survivability", "description": "The TIPS satellite was deployed on 20 June 1996 at an altitude\nof 1,022 kilometers (552 nautical miles).

Its primary objective is to study the dynamics of the\nEarth's magnetotail over a wide range of distance, extending from the\nnear-Earth region (8 Earth radii (Re) from the Earth) to the distant tail\n(about 200 Re). The GEOTAIL spacecraft was designed and built by ISAS and was\nlaunched on July 24, 1992.\n\nThe Geotail mission measures global energy flow and transformation in the\nmagnetotail to increase understanding of fundamental magnetospheric processes.\nThis will include the physics of the magnetopause, the plasma sheet, and\nreconnection and neutral line formation (i.e., the mechanisms of input,\ntransport, storage, release and conversion of energy in the magnetotail).\nGeotail, together with Wind, Polar, SOHO, and Cluster projects, constitute a\ncooperative scientific satellite project designated the International\nSolar-Terrestrial Physics (ISTP) program which aims at gaining improved\nunderstanding of the physics of solar terrestrial relations.\n\nGeotail is a spin-stabilized spacecraft utilizing mechanically despun antennas\nwith a design lifetime of about four years. The nominal spin rate of the\nspacecraft is about 20 rpm around a spin axis maintained between 85 and 89 deg\nto the ecliptic plane. Geotail is cylindrical, approximately 2.2 m in diameter\nand 1.6 m high with body-mounted solar cells. Geotail also has a two-hour\nback-up battery subsystem which operates when the spacecraft is in the Earth's\nshadow.\n\nReal-time telemetry data transmitted in the X-band are received at the Usuda\nDeep Space Center (UDSC) in Japan. There are two tape recorders on board, each\nwith a capacity of 450 Mbit which allow daily 24-hour data coverage. The data\nare collected in playback mode by the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).\n\nThe Geotail mission is divided into two phases. During the two-year initial\nphase, the orbit apogee was kept on the nightside of the Earth by using the\nMoon's gravity in a series of double-lunar swing-by maneuvers that result in\nthe spacecraft spending most of its time in the distant magnetotail (maximum\napogee about 200 Earth radii) with a period varying from one to four months.\nThen, starting in November 1994, there were a series of maneuvers to bring the\nspacecraft into its near-Earth orbit. This transition orbit lasted about three\nmonths with the apogee varying from 50 RE to 30 RE. The second phase is\ndedicated to the study of near-Earth magnetospheric processes, including\nneutral line formation.\n\nThe GEOTAIL mission consists of the following experiments:\n- Comprehensive Plasma Investigation (CPI)\n- Electric Fields Detector (EFD)\n- Energetic Particle and Ion Composition (EPIC)\n- High-Energy Particles (HEP)\n- Low-Energy Particles (LEP)\n- Magnetic Field Experiment\n- Plasma Waves Investigation (PWI)\n\nFor more information, see:\nhttp://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/geotail.shtml\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: GEOTAIL\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Solar/Space Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: GEOTAIL\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: GGS/Geotail\n      Short_Name: GTL\n      Short_Name: Geomagnetic Tail Lab\n      Short_Name: ISTP/Geotail\n      Short_Name: 22049\n      Short_Name: 1992-044A\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: MFE\n      Short_Name: PWI\n      Short_Name: LEP\n      Short_Name: HEP\n      Short_Name: EPIC\n      Short_Name: EFD\n      Short_Name: CPI-G\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Inclination: 5.15 degrees - 7.45 degrees\n      Period: 43 days - 49 days\n      Perigee: 47,835 km - 51,024 km\n      Apogee: 869,421 km - 191,340 km\n      Orbit_Type: HEO > Highly Elliptical Orbit\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/geotail.shtml\n   Online_Resource: http://www.stp.isas.ac.jp/geotail/\n   Sample_Image: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/image/spacecraft/geotail.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1992-07-24\n      Launch_Site: Cape Canaveral/Kennedy Space Center, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: ISAS, Japan\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "R/V POLARSTERN": {"short_name": "R/V POLARSTERN", "description": "The Polarstern spends almost 310 days a year at sea.

The program, previously known as Data Acquisition and Processing Program (DAPP), was classified until March 1973. The objective of this program was to provide global visual and infrared (IR) cloudcover data and specialized environmental data to support Department of Defense requirements. Operationally, the program consisted of two satellites in 830 km sun-synchronous polar orbits, with the ascending node of one satellite near the sunrise terminator and the other near local noon. The satellite, shaped like the frustum of a polyhedron, consisted of four subassemblies -- (1) a solar array hat, (2) a base-plate assembly, (3) a sensor AVE (Aerospace Vehicle Electronics) package (SAP), and (4) a data processing system. The primary sensor (SAP) was a four channel scanning radiometer. Secondary sensors included a vertical temperature profile radiometer (supplementary sensor E -SSE) and an electron spectrograph (supplementary sensor J/2 - SSJ/2), which were mounted, along with the primary sensor, on the base-plate assembly. Spacecraft stabilization was controlled by a combination flywheel and magnetic control coil system so that the sensors were maintained in the desired earth-looking mode. The data processing system included three tape recorders capable of storing a total of 440 min of data, which allowed full global coverage twice daily. Either recorded or real-time data were transmitted to ground receiving sites via an s-band transmitter. Recorded data were read out to tracking sites located at Fairchild AFB, Wa, and Loring AFB, ME, and relayed to Air Force Global Weather Central, Offutt AFB, NE.

The WorldView mission is intended to provide imaging services to NGA as well as to the commercial customer base of DigitalGlobe.\n\nSpacecraft:\n\nBATC (Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corporation) of Boulder, CO, is the prime contractor and integrator of the spacecraft, providing the S/C bus (Ball Commercial Platform BCP-5000) and a WorldView-60 camera. A new feature of the WorldView spacecraft are CMG (Control Moment Gyroscopes) actuators for precise and highly responsive pointing control. The BCP-5000 bus provides increased power, stability, agility, data storage and transmission (over the BCP-2000 bus) as the demand for Earth remote-sensing information becomes more comprehensive. \n\nThe S/C is 3-axis stabilized. The ADCS (Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem) employs star trackers, IRU (Inertial Reference Unit) and GPS for attitude sensing, and CMGs as actuators. A S/C body-pointing range of \u00b140\u00ba about nadir is provided corresponding to a FOR (Field of Regard) of 775 km in cross-track. An instantaneous pointing accuracy of \u2264 500 m is provided at any start and stop of an imaging sequence. On the ground, the geolocation accuracy of the imagery is 5.8 to 7.6 m without GPCs (Ground Control Points) and 2 m with GPCs (3\u03c3). The agile S/C provides retargeting at a rate of 4.5\u00ba/s with an acceleration of 2.5\u00ba/s2; it takes 9 s to slew the S/C over a ground distance of 300 km.\n\nS/C power of 3.2 kW (EOL) is provided by the solar panels; the battery capacity is 100 Ah. The solar arrays are being articulated into the sun (normal pointing into the sun). The rotational drive assemblies and drive control electronics, referred to as QuAD (Quiet Array Drive), are being provided by Starsys, a subsidiary of SpaceDev, Poway, CA. Unlike traditional stepper motor solar array drives, the QuAD technology provides low disturbance actuation, allowing spacecraft images to be captured at the same time that the solar arrays are being pointed.\n\nThe S/C bus has dimensions of 3.6 m (high) and 2.5 m in diameter, the span of the deployed panels measures 7.1 m. WorldView-1 has a launch mass of 2500 kg. The mission design life is 7.25 years. \n\nLaunch: A launch of the WorldView-1 spacecraft took place on Sept. 18, 2007 on a Delta-2920 vehicle from VAFB, CA.\n\nOrbit: Sun-synchronous circular orbit, altitude = 496 km (nominal), inclination = 97.2\u00ba. The equator crossing time is at 10:30 hours on a descending node. The period is 94.6 minutes. Note: While the low-altitude orbit selection offers better spatial resolutions than a higher one, it requires also more frequent reboosts to maintain the low orbit due to atmospheric drag influences.\n\nRF communications: The command data are in S-band at 2 or 64 kbit/s. The housekeeping telemetry and tracking is in X-band at 4, 16, or 32 kbit/s of real-time data, or 524 kbit/s of stored data. The imagery is downlinked in X-band at 800 Mbit/s. The S/C provides a data storage capacity of 2.2 Tbit in solid state memory with EDAC (Error Detection and Correction). A total of 331 Gbit of imagery per orbit may be collected.  In addition, direct (real-time) downlinks to customer sites are available using the same high-speed 800 Mbit/s X-band link. \n\nMission status: In early January 2008, DigitalGlobe announced the general availability of WorldView-1 imagery to its customers after all check-out aspects of the spacecraft and its payload had been completed. 6)\n\n\u2022 DigitalGlobe delivered its first sample set of high-resolution images on Oct. 15, 2007 and began supplying imagery to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) on Nov. 26, 2007 (the S/C reached already full operating capacity on Nov. 17. 2007). \n\nInformaiton obtained from http://www.eoportal.org/\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: WORLDVIEW-1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: WORLDVIEW-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: CAMERAS\n      Short_Name: MS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 496\n      Orbit_Inclination: 97.2\n      Period: 94.5\n      Repeat_Cycle: 1.7\n      Perigee: 499.7\n      Apogee: 500.8\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-10\n   Online_Resource: http://directory.eoportal.org/get_announce.php?an_id=12389\n   Online_Resource: http://www.digitalglobe.com/index.php/86/WorldView-1\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2007-09-18\n      Launch_Site: Vandenberg Air Force Base, USA\n      Design_Life: 7.25 years\n      Primary_Sponsor: National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, USA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "NASA S-3B VIKING": {"short_name": "NASA S-3B VIKING", "description": "The Lockheed S-3 Viking is a jet aircraft originally used by the United States Navy to identify, track, and destroy enemy submarines.

The third stage was required to rocket Pioneer 10\nto the speed of 51,810 kilometers per hour (32,400 mph) needed for the flight\nto Jupiter. This made Pioneer the fastest manmade object to leave the Earth,\nfast enough to pass the Moon in 11 hours and to cross the Mars orbit, about 80\nmillion kilometers (50 million miles) away, in just 12 weeks.\n\nOn 15 July 1972 Pioneer 10 entered the Asteroid Belt, a doughnut shaped area\nwhich measures some 280 million kilometers wide and 80 million kilometers\nthick. The material in the belts travels at speed about 20 km/sec. and ranges\nin size from dust particles to rock chunks as big as Alaska.\n\nAfter safely traversing the Asteroid Belt, Pioneer 10 headed toward Jupiter.\nAccelerated by the massive giant to a speed of 132,000 km/hr (82,000 mph),\nPioneer 10 passed by Jupiter within 130,354 km (81,000 miles) of the cloudtops\non December 3, 1973. During the passage by Jupiter, Pioneer 10 obtained the\nfirst close-up images of the planet, charted Jupiter's intense radiation belts,\nlocated the planet's magnetic field, and discovered that Jupiter is\npredominantly a liquid planet.\n\nFollowing its encounter with Jupiter, Pioneer 10 explored the outer regions of\nthe Solar system, studying energetic particles from the Sun (Solar Wind), and\ncosmic rays entering our portion of the Milky Way. The spacecraft continued to\nmake valuable scientific investigations in the outer regions of the solar\nsystem until its science mission ended on March 31, 1997. Since that time,\nPioneer 10's weak signal has been tracked by the DSN as part of an advanced\nconcept study of communication technology in support of NASA's future\ninterstellar probe mission. The spacecraft had also been used to help train\nflight controllers how to acquire radio signals from space during the Lunar\nProspector mission. The power source on Pioneer 10 finally degraded to the\npoint where the signal to Earth dropped below the threshold for detection in\nits latest contact attempt on 7 February, 2003. The previous three contacts had\nvery faint signals with no telemetry received.

Terra is the first EOS (Earth Observing System) platform and provides global data on the state of the atmosphere, land, and oceans, as well as their interactions with solar radiation and with one another.\n\nSince the 1950's, it has become increasingly clear that human activities are modifying the composition of the atmosphere on a global scale. As the result of industrialization, the concentration of carbon dioxide has increased by about 20% during this period. More recently, the stratospheric concentrations of chemically-active gases containing chlorine, bromine, and fluorine have dramatically increased. These trends have created issues of global interest including global warming and declining levels of ozone (both globally and in the ozone &hole& in the Antarctic). It has become increasingly clear, however, that these processes do not occur independently of one another and can only be understood in the context of a global system. Accurate and precise measurements are needed to unravel complex and interactive relationships between chemical, radiative, and dynamical processes in the atmosphere, ocean, and on land. As a result, in 1991 NASA initiated a comprehensive program to understand the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, land, and cryosphere (ice and snow) as a single, complex, interactive system. NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) consists of a series of spaceborne instruments to monitor crucial components of the Earth system, an advanced data handling system, and teams of scientists who will evaluate on-going climate change and predict future changes. Ultimately, EOS will produce scientifically sound recommendations for environmental policy to national and international bodies to mitigate or prepare for these changes.\n\nKey Terra Facts:\nJoint with Japan and Canada\nOrbit:\nType: Near-polar, sun-synchronous\nEquatorial Crossing: 10:30 a.m.\nAltitude: 705 km\nInclination: 98.1 degrees\nPeriod: 98.88 minutes\nRepeat Cycle: 16 days\nDimensions: 2.7 m x 3.3 m x 6.8 m\nMass: 5,190 kg\nPower: 2,530 W\nDesign Life: 6 years\n\nTerra Status:\nOperating instruments: ASTER, CERES, MODIS, MISR, and MOPITT are operating well.

The docking in\nspace of, the two spacecraft took place at 2:17\np.m. U.S. central time on July 17. Two days worth of joint\noperations followed. After separation, the Soyuz remained in\nspace for almost two days before landing in the U.S.S.R. on July\n21. The Apollo spacecraft remained in space for another three\ndays before splashing down near Hawaii on July 24.\n\nThe mission was a resounding success for both Americans and\nSoviets.

NASA and NOAA share responsibility for CLARREO. The NOAA component involves the continuity of measurements of incident solar irradiance and Earth energy budget by flying the TSIS and CERES sensors that were removed from NPOESS. The NASA portion involves the measurement of spectrally resolved thermal IR and reflected solar radiation at high absolute accuracy. Coupled with measurements from on-board GPS radio occultation receivers, these measurements will provide a long-term benchmarking data record for the detection, projection, and attribution of changes in the climate system. In addition, the SI traceable radiances will provide a source of absolute calibration for a wide range of visible and IR Earth observing sensors, greatly increasing their value for climate monitoring.\n\nCLARREO is a Highly Leveraged Interdisciplinary Climate Change Mission\n\n - Accurate decadal-length records are essential for climate change detection, attribution, and for testing climate prediction accuracy. They represent the most critical test of uncertainty in future climate change prediction.\n\n- While process study missions (e.g. CALIPSO/CloudSat) are critical to improve underlying climate model physics (e.g. clouds), decadal change observations are critical to determine the impact of those climate model improvements on the accuracy of predicting future climate change. Both elements are critical, and CLARREO is the major Decadal Study mission addressing serious accuracy issues in decadal climate change observation.\n \n- The CLARREO mission is unique in its broad interdisciplinary impact on climate change science: the other NRC Decadal Survey missions are primarily focused on one climate process or discipline.\n\n- CLARREO provides new solar reflected and infrared emitted high spectral resolution benchmark radiance climate data records that can be used to test climate model predictions, improve climate change fingerprinting, and attribution.\n\n- CLARREO provides an orbiting calibration observatory that can be used to calibrate other solar and infrared space-borne sensors (e.g. VIIRS, CrIS, Landsat, Geostationary, CERES) and thereby improve to climate accuracy a wide range of sensors across the GEO observing system. It also improves the scientific value of all of these instruments.\n\n- Key climate variable decadal records impacted by CLARREO include: atmospheric temperature and water vapor profiles, land and sea surface temperatures, cloud properties, radiation budget including Earths albedo, vegetation, surface snow and ice properties, ocean color, and aerosols. The data is also relevant to greenhouse gas monitoring.\n\n- The absolute accuracy of CLARREO, when used to calibrate other sensors in orbit can dramatically reduce the impact of data gaps on decadal change data records across many climate variables.\n\n- CLARREO provides the first spectrally resolved climate observation of the Far-Infrared spectrum from 15 to 50 micron wavelengths, where half of the thermal infrared emission of the earth to space occurs, and the source of almost all of the Earth's water vapor greenhouse effect.\n\n- CLARREO\u2019s ability to calibrate other instruments across the full solar and infrared spectrum can change the future prioritization of different elements of instrument pre-launch characterization (e.g. spectral response), stability, and calibration, thereby resulting in increased programmatic flexibility and savings. \n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: CLARREO\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: NASA Decadal Survey\n      Short_Name: CLARREO\n      Long_Name: Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: INFRARED INSTRUMENT SUITE\n      Short_Name: GNSS-RO RECEIVER\n      Short_Name: REFLECTED SOLAR SUITE\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2009-02-25\n   Online_Resource: http://clarreo.larc.nasa.gov/\n   Online_Resource: http://nasascience.nasa.gov/missions/clarreo\n   Online_Resource: http://decadal.gsfc.nasa.gov/clarreo.html\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "GCOM-W1": {"short_name": "GCOM-W1", "long_name": "Global Change Observation Mission 1st-Water", "description": "The GCOM-W mission aims to establish the global and long-term observation system to collect data, which is needed to understand mechanisms of climate and water cycle variations, and demonstrate its utilization.

This program, previously known as DAPP (Data Acquisition and Processing Program), was classified until March 1973. The objective of this program is to provide global visual and infrared cloudcover data and specialized environmental data to support Department of Defense operational weather analysis and forecasting requirements. Operationally, the program consists of two satellites in planned 830-km, sun-synchronous polar orbits, with the ascending node of one satellite in early morning and the other at local noon. The 6.4-m-long spacecraft is separated into four sections: (1) a precision mounting platform for sensors and equipment requiring precise alignment; (2) an equipment support module containing the electronics, reaction wheels, and some meteorological sensors; (3) a reaction control equipment support structure containing the third-stage rocket motor and supporting the ascent phase reaction control equipment; and (4) a 9.29-sq-m solar cell panel. The spacecraft stabilization is controlled by a combination flywheel and magnetic control coil system so sensors are maintained in the desired \"earth-looking\" mode. One feature is the precision-pointing accuracy of the primary imager to 0.01 deg provided by a star sensor and an updated ephemeris navigation system. This allows automatic geographical mapping of the digital imagery to the nearest picture element. The operational linescan system is the primary data acquisition system that provides real-time or stored, multi-orbit, day-and-night visual and infrared imagery of clouds. A supplementary sensor package contains four special sensors: (1) an advanced X-ray spectrometer, (2) an ionospheric/scintillation monitor, (3) a precipitating electron/ion spectrometer, and (4) an infrared temperature and moisture sounder. Either recorded or real-time data are transmitted to ground-receiving sites by two redundant S-band transmitters. Recorded data are read out to tracking sites located at Fairchild AFB, Washington, and at Loring AFB, Maine, and relayed by SATCOM to Air Force Global Weather Center, Offutt AFB, Nebraska. Real-time data are read out at mobile tactical sites located around the world. Additional information concerning this satellite program can be found in the report by D.A.

TRMM is particularly devoted to determining rainfall in the tropics and subtropics of the Earth. These regions make up about two thirds of the total rainfall on Earth and are responsible for driving our weather and climate system. TRMM contributed to a better understanding of where and how much the winds blow, where the clouds form and rain occurs, where floods and droughts will occur, and how the winds drive the ocean currents. TRMM accomplished this not just by providing rainfall data but, more importantly, by providing information on heat released into the atmosphere as part of the process that leads to rain.\n\nTRMM was launched on November 27, 1997, on the Japanese H-II vehicle from the Tanegashima Space Center in Tanegashima, Japan. Continuous science data collection began December 8, 1997. Upon completion of the nominal 3-year prime mission, the decision was made to boost the mission from its original altitude of 350km to 402.5km, to reduce fuel consumption and extend the mission life. The TRMM boost was completed August 24, 2001, and the orbit was maintained until 2014, when fuel was depleted and the spacecraft began to descend. Mission operations were terminated in April 2015, the spacecraft re-entered the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and mostly burned up in June 2015.\n\nTRMM exceeded its 3-year design goal by collecting 17 years of rainfall data, creating a benchmark rainfall climatology which is used to test, compare and improve global climate models. The TRMM dataset of rain distribution across the tropics has narrowed considerably the range of uncertainty in previous space-based rainfall estimates. The choice of a precessing, low-inclination orbit (35\u00b0) enabled the quantification of the diurnal cycle of precipitation and convective intensity over land and ocean tropics-wide on fine scales (0.25\u00b0). TRMM products have provided the first comprehensive estimates of how rainfall is directly related to latent heat release in the atmosphere, a key characteristic in understanding the impact of tropical rainfall on the general circulation of the atmosphere. Based on hydrometeor vertical structure information from the TRMM active and passive sensors, TRMM produced climatologies of latent heating profiles for analysis and comparison with global models. In addition, the lightning sensor delivered a detailed global map of lightning distribution, and combined with the rain data, led to quantifying the lightning/convection relation for land and ocean.\n\n\nLaunch:  Launched: November 27, 1997\nLaunch Site: Tanegashima Space Center, Japan\n\nOrbit:  Altitude: 402 km\nInclination: 35 degrees\nPeriod: 92.6 minutes\nNon-Sun-Synchronous\n\nVital Statistics: Weight: 3512 kg\nPower: 1100 watts\nDesign Life: 3 years\n\nInstruments: \nCERES (Clouds and the Earth Radiant Energy System\nLIS (Lightning Imaging Sensor)\nTMI (TRMM Microwave Radiometer)\nPR (RADAR)\nVIRS (Visible/Infrared Radiometer)\n\nWebsite: \nhttp://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov/ \nhttp://nasascience.nasa.gov/missions/trmm\n\n[Summary provided by NASA.]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: TRMM\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: TRMM\n      Long_Name: Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: TRMM\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: CERES-PFM\n      Short_Name: PR\n      Short_Name: TMI\n      Short_Name: VIRS\n      Short_Name: LIS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 402 km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 35 degrees\n      Period: 92.6 minutes\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Inclined Non-Polar\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-11-28\n   Online_Resource: http://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov/overview_dir/background.html\n   Online_Resource: http://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n   Online_Resource: http://nasascience.nasa.gov/missions/trmm\n   Online_Resource: http://pmm.nasa.gov/TRMM\n   Sample_Image: http://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov/trmm_rain/Events/TRMM_SATELLITE.blurred.medium.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1997-11-27\n      Launch_Site: Tanegashima Island, Japan\n      Design_Life: 3 YEARS\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n      Primary_Sponsor: JAPAN/JAXA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "SENTINEL-3": {"short_name": "SENTINEL-3", "description": "PREFERRED TERMS: 3A, S3B, S3C, S3D, Sentinel-3\nDEFINITION\nThe Sentinel-3 (S3) mission of ESA and the EC is one of the elements of the GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security) program, which responds to the requirements for operational and near-real-time monitoring of ocean, land and ice surfaces over a period of 20 years.

SDO is designed to help us understand study the Sun's influence on Earth and Near-Earth space by studying observing the solar atmosphere on small scales of space and time and in many wavelengths simultaneously.\n\nSDO's goal is to understand, driving towards a predictive capability, the solar variations that influence life on Earth and humanity's technological systems by determining how the Sun's magnetic field is generated and structured how this stored magnetic energy is converted and released into the heliosphere and geospace in the form of solar wind, energetic particles, and variations in the solar irradiance. SDO data will help us to understand the cause the how and why of the Sun's magnetic activity changes. It will determine how the magnetic field is generated and structured, and how the stored magnetic energy is released into the heliosphere and geospace. SDO data and analysis will also help us develop the ability to predict the solar activity variations. that influence life on Earth and humanity's technological systems.\n\nSDO will observe different layers in solar atmosphere from visible surface, photosphere, to outer corona. measure the properties of the Sun and solar activity. There are few types of measurements but many of them will be taken. For example, Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) will record maps of magnetic fields on entire visible solar hemisphere. HMI will also observe flows of plasma in the photosphere. These observations will be used to study motions throughout solar atmosphere: from the global scale (solar rotation), to small spatial scales (e.g. convective motions, which the surface velocity is measured by HMI. This data can be used for many different studies. One is the surface rotation rate, which must be removed to study the others. After subtracting the rotation, you have the oscillation and convective velocities. The latter look like billows of storm clouds covering the Sun. Hot gas moves outward at the center of the billows and downward at the edges\u2014just like boiling water). Data from HMI will also allow us to study processes taking place underneath the visible surface. These studies will be conducted using methods of helioseismology, in the same manner as geologies on Earth study interior of our planet. Other SDO instruments,  Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) will study hot outer layers of solar atmosphere, corona. AIA will take images and movies of corona in several wavelengths of ultraviolet light. The third SDO instrument, ), Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE)  will observe total every flux from the Sun, or irradiance. The variations in irradiance are important component of Earth's atmosphere and climate models. \n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: SDO\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Solar/Space Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: Living with a Star\n      Short_Name: SDO\n      Long_Name: Solar Dynamics Observatory\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: SDO\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: HMI-SDO\n      Short_Name: AIA-SDO\n      Short_Name: EVE-SDO\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 36,000 km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 28.5 degrees\n      Orbit_Type: GEO > Geosynchronous > Non-Geostationary\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2009-04-24\n   Online_Resource: http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n   Online_Resource: http://nasascience.nasa.gov/missions/sdo\n   Sample_Image: http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/425451main_AV021-Launch425x.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2010-02-11\n      Launch_Site: Cape Canaveral/Kennedy Space Center, USA\n      Design_Life: 5 years 3 months\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "METOP": {"short_name": "METOP", "long_name": "Meteorological Operational Satelite", "description": "The Meteorological Operational satellite programme (MetOp) is a European undertaking providing weather data services to monitor the climate and improve weather forecasts.

The German Space Agency (DARA) and the Italian Space Agency (ASI) are providing the X-SAR instrument.\n\nThe imaging radar of the SIR-C/X-SAR instruments has the ability to make measurements over virtually any region at any time, regardless of weather or sunlight conditions. The radar waves can penetrate clouds, and under certain conditions, also can \"see\" through vegetation, ice and extremely dry sand. In many cases, radar is the only way scientists can explore inaccessible regions of the Earth's surface.\n\nThe SIR-C/X-SAR radar data provide information about how many of Earth's complex systems - those processes that control the movement of land, water, air and life - work together to make this a livable planet. The science team particularly wants to study the amount of vegetation coverage, the extent of snow packs, wetlands areas, geologic features such as rock types and their distribution, volcanic activity, ocean wave heights and wind speed. STS-68 will fly over the same sites that STS-59 observed so that scientists will be able to study seasonal changes that may have occurred in those areas between the missions.\n\nAn international team of 49 science investigators and three associates will conduct the SIR-C/X-SAR experiments. Thirteen nations are represented: Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and the United States.

The cylindrically shaped spacecraft measured 190.5 cm in diameter and 230 cm in length, exclusive of a magnetometer that extended an additional 83 cm beyond the cylinder shell. The primary structural members were a honeycombed equipment shelf and thrust tube. The VISSR telescope was mounted on the equipment shelf and viewed the Earth through a special aperture in the side of the spacecraft. A support structure extended radially out from the thrust tube and was affixed to the solar panels, which formed the outer walls of the spacecraft and provided the primary source of electrical power. Located in the annulus-shaped space between the thrust tube and the solar panels were stationkeeping and dynamics control equipment, batteries, and most of the SEM equipment. Proper spacecraft attitude and spin rate (approximately 100 rpm) were maintained by two separate sets of jet thrusters mounted around the spacecraft equator and activated by ground command. The spacecraft used both UHF-band and S-band frequencies in its telemetry and command subsystem. A low-power VHF transponder provided telemetry and command during launch and then served as a backup for the primary subsystem once the spacecraft attained orbit. The spin-stabilized spacecraft carried a visible infrared spin-scan radiometer atmospheric sounder, meteorological data collection and transmission system, space environment monitor, and a biaxial fluxgate magnetometer. GOES 6 was moved from its 135 degrees West position to a more central 98 degrees West position when GOES 5 failed on July 29, 1984.

The Venera 14 mission consisted of a bus (81-110A)\nand an attached descent craft (81-110D). The Venera 14 descent\ncraft/lander was a hermetically sealed pressure vessel, which\ncontained most of the instrumentation and electronics, mounted\non a ring-shaped landing platform and topped by an antenna.

The program is managed in cooperation by ASI and MOD. Each of the four satellites is equipped with a SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) instrument and is capable of operating in all visibility conditions at high resolution and in real time.\n\nThe overall objective of this program is global Earth observation and the relevant data exploitation for the needs of the military community as well as for the civil (institutional, commercial) community.\n\nSample applications of COSMO-SkyMed data are seen the following fields:\n\n\u2022 Defense and security applications: Surveillance, intelligence, mapping, damage assessment, vulnerability assessment, target detection/localization\n\n\u2022 Risk management applications: Floods, droughts, landslides, volcanic/seismic, forest fire, industrial hazards, water pollution\n\n\u2022 Other applications: Marine and coastal environments, agriculture, forestry, cartography, environment, geology and exploration, telecommunication, utilities and planning\n\n\u2022 Provision of commercial imaging services\n\n\u2022 The high revisit frequency offered by the four X-band SAR spacecraft is also expected to provide a unique potential to the operational meteorological user community through provision of ancillary data and/or data on meteo-correlated phenomena, in particular as regards sea ice monitoring and study of ocean wave patterns.\n\nBackground: In 1996 the Italian Government provided initial funding for the realization of a national Earth observation program. In 1997 the general guidelines for the 1998-2002 Italian National Space Plan (PSN) were approved including the activities on Earth observation. The strategic element in this plan is the COSMO-SkyMed dual-use program of ASI. 1) 2)\n\nIn the summer of 2001, the Italian Ministry of Defense became a partner in the COSMO-SkyMed program (a welcome funding partner for the Italian Ministry of Research). However, the dual-use nature of the COSMO-SkyMed program, i. e. civil (research and commercial) and military use of its data products, resulted in a virtually classified program. A great disadvantage of the new arrangement is that rather sparse technical information of the mission can only be made available to the public.\n\nAlthough the first constellation satellite SAR instruments (SAR-2000) will observe in X-band (9.6 GHz with a wavelength of 3.1 cm), multi-mode scenarios (X-, C- L- and P-band) are planned for the future.\n\nThe overall system architecture is composed of a space segment, a constellation of SAR satellites, and a ground segment including full featured user services. The requirements call for the following general performance characteristics: 3)\n\n\u2022 Full global observation coverage with all weather, day/night acquisition capability\n\n\u2022 Collection capability of large areas within a single pass, with along-track stereo imaging during a single pass\n\n\u2022 High image quality, to allow a robust image interpretability at the requested scale of analysis (data sets are characterized by adequate spatial and spectral resolution suitable to perform analyses at different scales of detail)\n\n\u2022 Ground track repeatability: the satellites of the SAR constellation shall have a ground track repeatability of better than 1 km\n\n\u2022 Fast response times (from the data/service user request up to the data/service delivery to that requiring user).\n\nThe SABRINA project was started in 2004/5. \n\nThe COSMO-SkyMed space segment is composed of a constellation of four SAR satellites. The PRIMA \\[Piattaforma Riconfigurabile Italiana Multi-Applicativa (Reconfigurable Italian Platform for Multiple Applications)\\] bus of Alcatel Alenia Space is being employed. Alcatel Alenia Space is also the prime contractor of the space segment \\[funding by ASI and I-AD (Ministry of Defense)\\]. - Note: As of April 10, 2007, the EC approved the transfer to Thales of Alcatel-Lucent's shareholdings in the two space sector joint venture companies Alcatel Alenia Space and Telespazio. Hence, Alcatel Alenia Space was renamed to Thales Alenia Space.\n\nThe S/C is three-axis stabilized, it consists of the main body (bus), two deployable solar arrays, and a SAR antenna. The bus provides all support functions like: AOCS, electrical power (power generation, storage and distribution), data handling, thermal control, RF communications, and on-orbit propulsion for orbit injection and maintenance. The platform mechanical configuration consists of two elements or modules, namely:\n\n\u2022 SVM (Service Module) at the bottom of the bus which contains all bus subsystems including the propulsion module\n\n\u2022 PLM (Payload Module) at the top, dedicated to the payload complement, the PDHT (Payload Data Handing and Transmission) subsystem, and the AOCS (Attitude and Orbit Control Subsystem) with star trackers gyros actuators.\n\nThe bus structure material is CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic) while SVM and PLM consist of aluminum alloys. The interfaces of the SAR antenna, star trackers and gyros are mounted on the CFRP structure for pointing precision and stability (a star tracker is being used as well as a high-quality GPS receiver). The SSTI (Satellite-to-Satellite Tracking Instrument) is the LAGRANGE GPS receiver of Laben SpA. The SAR antenna bore sight is pointing with an incidence angle about 38\u00ba to the right side of the S/C ground track. AOCS provides an antenna steering capability of \u00b12\u00ba in yaw as well as for a re-pointing capability to the left side of the ground track. Each S/C in the constellation features a RCT (Reaction Control Thruster) system for orbit maintenance.\n\nThe mass of each spacecraft is about 1700 kg. The design life is 5 years. The S/C provides an onboard operational autonomy for a period of 24 hours. \n\nLaunch: The launch of the first COSMO spacecraft in the constellation took place on June 8, 2007 (UTC). The launch was provided by the Boeing Company on a Delta-2 (7420-10 configuration) vehicle from VAFB, CA.

The cylindrically shaped spacecraft measured 190.5 cm in diameter and 230 cm in length, exclusive of a magnetometer that extended an additional 83 cm beyond the cylinder shell. The primary structural members were a honeycombed equipment shelf and thrust tube. The VISSR telescope was mounted on the equipment shelf and viewed the Earth through a special aperture in the side of the spacecraft. A support structure extended radially from the thrust tube and was affixed to the solar panels, which formed the outer walls of the spacecraft and provided the primary source of electrical power. Located in the annulus-shaped space between the thrust tube and the solar panels were stationkeeping and dynamics control equipment, batteries, and most of the SEM equipment. Proper spacecraft attitude and spin rate (approximately 100 rpm) were maintained by two separate sets of jet thrusters mounted around the spacecraft equator and activated by ground command. The spacecraft used both UHF-band and S-band frequencies in its telemetry and command subsystem. A low-power VHF transponder provided telemetry and command during launch and then served as a backup for the primary subsystem once the spacecraft attained orbit. This spin-stabilized spacecraft carried a visible infrared spin-scan radiometer, meteorological data collection and relay system, space environment monitor, and a biaxial fluxgate magnetometer.

When GOES 5 VAS experienced a failure on July 30, 1984, GOES 6 was moved east and GOES 1 was reactivated by NOAA to provide visible imaging capability over the western U.S. GOES 1 failed on February 3, 1985.

The success of Echo 1A proved that microwave transmission to and from satellites in space was understood and demonstrated the promise of communications satellites. The vehicle also provided data for the calculation of atmospheric density and solar pressure due to its large area-to-mass ratio. Echo 1A was visible to the unaided eye over most of the Earth (brighter than most stars) and was probably seen by more people than any other man-made object in space. Echo 2 continued the passive communications experiments, and also investigated the dynamics of large spacecraft and was used for global geometric geodesy.

Through this region particles and energy flow from the\ngeomagnetic tail to the atmosphere. Thus the instruments on the Polar\nsatellites see a lot of action in the various plasma parameters that they\nmeasure.\n\nThree of the twelve scientific instruments aboard the Polar satellite are used\nto image the aurora in various wavelengths when the satellite is near apogee,\nhigh over the northern polar region. The other nine instruments make\nmeasurements in-situ, at the location of the satellite, around the entire\norbit. They measure the fluxes of charged particles, electrons and protons,  as\nwell as heavier ions, from thermal energies into MeV energies. They measure\nmagnetic and electric fields, plus electromagnetic waves. They must make these\nmeasurements in great detail in order for scientists to be able to learn new\nthings about the environment in the region over the poles of the Earth.\n\nThe Polar satellite is in a highly elliptical orbit, with apogee at 9 earth\nradii and perigee at 1.8 earth radii geocentric. The inclination is 86 deg. and\nthe period about 18 hours. Initially apogee was over the northern polar region,\nbut apogee has been moving towards the equator at about 16 deg. per year.  The\nnominal mission duration was two years, but a three year extended  mission has\nbeen approved.  \n\nDetails on the POLAR mission and instrumentation are provided in Space Science\nReviews (Vol. 71, Nos. 1-4, 1995) and reprinted in The Global Geospace Mission,\nedited by C.

The\nspacecraft was a 9.8 kg magnesium sphere 50.8 cm in diameter. It\ncontained two optical telescopes with two photocells. The sphere was\ninternally gold-plated and externally covered with an aluminum deposit\ncoated with silicon oxide of sufficient thickness to provide thermal\ncontrol for the instrumentation. Radio communication was provided by a\n1-W, 108.03-MHz telemetry transmitter and a 10-mW, 108-MHz beacon\ntransmitter that sent a continuous signal for tracking purposes. A\ncommand receiver was used to activate a tape recorder that relayed\ntelescope experiment data to the telemetry transmitter. Both\ntransmitters functioned normally for 19 days. The satellite was spin\nstabilized at 50 rpm, but telemetry data were poor because of an\nunsatisfactory orientation of the spin axis. The power supply for the\ninstrumentation was provided by mercury batteries.\n                  - Auxiliary Information -\n    Launch Date and Time :  1959-02-17 16:05:00\n    Epoch Date and Time  :  1959-02-17 16:48:00\n    Apogee (km or AU):      3320.\n    Perigee (km or AU):     559.\n    Inclination (degree) :  32.88\n    Orbit Type :            Geocentric\n    Information last updated on 1992-04-14\nVanguard 3 was launched by a Vanguard rocket from the Eastern Test\nRange into a geocentric orbit. The objectives of the flight were to\nmeasure the earth's magnetic field, the solar X-ray radiation and its\neffects on the earth's atmosphere, and the near-earth micrometeoroid\nenvironment. Instrumentation included a proton magnetometer, X-ray\nionization chambers, and various micrometeoroid detectors. The\nspacecraft was a 50.8-cm-diameter magnesium sphere. The magnetometer\nwas housed in a glass fiber phenolic resin conical tube attached to\nthe sphere. Data transmission stopped on December 11, 1959, after 84\ndays of operation. The data obtained provided a comprehensive survey\nof the earth's magnetic field over the area covered, defined the lower\nedge of the Van Allen radiation belt, and provided a count of\nmicrometeoroid impacts.

The objective of this program, called the TIROS Operational\nSystem (TOS), was to acquire global observational data routinely on a daily\nbasis.  This system consisted of a pair of ESSA satellites in sun synchronous\n(polar) orbit.  The odd numbered satellites (ESSA-1, 3, 5, 7, and 9) utilized\nthe Advanced Vidicon Camera System (AVCS) to obtain global imagery which were\ntransmitted to the ESSA Command and Data Acquisition (CDA) stations at Wallops,\nVirginia, and Fairbanks, Alaska.  The CDA stations relayed the data to\nthe National Environmental Satellite Service (NESS), which later became the\nNational Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS),\nlocated in Suitland, Maryland, for processing and distribution to forecasting\ncenters of the U.S. and other nations.  The even numbered satellites (ESSA-2,\n4, 6, and 8) were equipped with Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) TV cameras\nwhich transmitted television pictures directly to ground stations worldwide.\nThe ESSA satellites operated in orbits at altitudes of approximately 1450 km.\n     The second generation operational polar orbiting satellites started with\nthe ITOS-1 (Improved TIROS Operational System) mission launched on January 23,\n1970 which combined the joint capabilities of two ESSA spacecraft; essentially,\nthe direct readout APT system and the global stored images of the AVCS.  The\nsecond generation objectives were to provide improved operational Infrared\n(IR) and Visible (VIS) observations of Earth cloud cover for use in weather\nanalysis and forecasting and also to provide solar proton and global heat data\non a daily basis.  ITOS-1 also carried an operational 2 channel Scanning\nRadiometer (SR) providing day and night radiometric data for immediate\ntransmission as well as acquisition data stored for delayed transmission to CDA\nstations.  With an Infrared 5 channel scanner, global observation of the Earth\natmosphere and surface areas was available once every 12 hours.  A second ITOS\nspacecraft, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellite,\nNOAA-1, was launched on December 11, 1970.\n     The ITOS system evolved further with the development of the ITOS-D\nsatellites, NOAA-2, 3, 4, and 5 and were placed into orbit in 1972, 1973, 1974,\nand 1975, respectively.  These had a new sensor complement to provide day and\nnight imaging by means of the Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR) along with\nthe medium resolution Scanning Radiometer (SR).  The Vertical Temperature\nProfile Radiometer (VTPR) for sounding the atmosphere and the Solar Proton\nMonitor (SPM) for measurements of solar proton and electron flux in the\nvicinity of the satellite were added.\n     The first spacecraft in the third generation operational polar orbiting\nenvironmental satellite system was TIROS-N which was launched in 1978.  The\nthird generation objectives were to provide observations for the atmosphere,\ncloud cover, surface and near-surface.  The TIROS-N type satellites that\nfollowed were NOAA-A (6), NOAA-B which failed to achieve useful orbit, NOAA-C\n(7), and NOAA-D.  The TIROS-N system provided NOAA with the global\nmeteorological and environmental data required for normal operations and for\nthe experimental World Weather Watch (WWW) Program.  The spacecraft had a new\ncomplement of data gathering instruments.  The Advanced Very High Resolution\nRadiometer (AVHRR) provided day and night imaging in the Visible (VIS) and\nInfrared (IR), sea surface temperature (SST) determination, estimation of heat\nbudget components, and identification of snow and sea ice.  The TIROS\nOperational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) supplied improved estimates of the vertical\nstructure of the atmosphere.  The Data Collection System (DCS) gathered\nenvironmental data from fixed and moving platforms such as buoys and\nballoons, and transmitted the data to central stations for processing and\nrelay to users.  The Solar Environment Monitor (SEM) measured solar proton,\nelectron, and alpha particle densities.  The data collected were stored onboard\nthe satellite for transmission to the NOAA central processing facility at\nSuitland, Maryland, through the Wallops and Fairbanks CDA stations.  Satellite\ndata also were transmitted in real time direct readout at VHF and S-band\nfrequencies to remote stations worldwide.\n     The Advanced TIROS-N (ATN) type satellites were NOAA-E (8), NOAA-F (9),\nNOAA-G (10), NOAA-H (11), NOAA-I (12), and NOAA-J (13), the latter two\nscheduled for launch in 1990 and 1991 respectively.  The spacecraft was\nlengthened 0.5m and the solar array was enlarged to provide additional power.\nNew systems were added starting with NOAA-8: the Search and Rescue (SAR)\nsystem; NOAA-9: the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) instruments and\nthe Solar Backscatter UltraViolet (SBUV) radiometer; NOAA-10: ERBE instruments.\nFor more information about the NOAA POES satellite series link to the\n-----------------\nEntry taken from:\nRao, P.K., S.J.

Two long crossed-dipole antennas (73 and 18.7 m) were used for the\nsounding, VLF, and cosmic noise experiments. The spacecraft was spin-stabilized\nto about 2 rpm after antenna deployment. There were two basic orientation modes\nfor the spacecraft, cartwheel and orbit-aligned. The spacecraft operated\napproximately the same length of time in each mode, remaining in one mode\ntypically 3 to 5 months. The cartwheel mode with the axis perpendicular to the\norbit plane was made available to provide ram and wake data for some\nexperiments for each spin period, rather than for each orbit period. Attitude\nand spin information was obtained from a three-axis magnetometer and a sun\nsensor. Control of attitude and spin was possible by means of magnetic\ntorquing. The experiment package also included a programmable tape recorder\nwith a 1-h capacity.

The overall objective is to provide medium-resolution imagery for developing countries for free. Around 50 data reception terminals will be installed by ISRO in selected Third World countries and also at some universities in India.\n\nhe project started in 2005 with a definition phase of the mission. The ISRO approach was to develop two versions of a standard small spacecraft bus (SSB) design with the objective to provide a low-cost and a quick-response time approach to space.\n\n\u2022 A microsatellite version (first use by the IMS-1 mission)\n\n\u2022 A minisatellite version (first use by the SARAL mission)\n\nThe main advantage of these \"smallsats\" is the fact that they can be launched by a PSLV vehicle as a piggyback payload on any one of the larger primary payloads (like IRS satellites).\n\nThe modular design concept of the SSB is suited for series production making the bus a natural choice for constellation-flight applications. The design layout is such that the bus module and the payload module of each series may be integrated and tested separately (thus reducing the interdependency during the realization between both modules). Each SSB version is 3-axis stabilized. SSB is also designed to accommodate different types of payloads with minor modification from mission to mission. \n\nThe SSB micro-bus uses aluminum honeycomb panels arranged in a cuboid structure with internal shear frames. This design is made to provide maximum area for mounting the packages while being sturdy. All the subsystem packages are mounted within the cuboid except sensors and antennas which are mounted outside. The structure includes a launch vehicle interface and solar panel interfaces. The payloads are mounted on the top deck, with optical axis towards the + yaw direction.\n\nThe power subsystem consists of solar panels, battery, power conditioning and distribution units. There are two solar panels of size 0.81m x 0.72 m in the roll direction of the satellite. The panels are stowed during the launch and deployed after injection to the orbit. The satellite is nominally in sun-pointing mode with the solar panels facing the sun. For every payload operation, the satellite is maneuvered into an Earth-pointing mode and goes back to the sun-pointing mode after the imaging operation. Multi-junction solar cells are being used to provide higher efficiency of power conversion to generate about 230 W. A Li-ion battery is used with a capacity of 10.5 Ah, having a mass of about 3.5 kg. The power subsystem provides a single raw bus of 28 to 33 V. There are four DC/DC converters which provide the required secondary voltages for the payloads and bus subsystems.\n\nThe AOCS (Attitude and Orbit Control Subsystem) uses sun sensors with 4\u03c0 FOV providing an accuracy of 0.5\u00ba in all axes. The sun sensors are being used for sun acquisition and safe mode detection and recovery. A MEMS-based magnetometer is being used in the spacecraft de-tumbling support mode and in the momentum dumping of the reaction wheels. A star sensor, providing an inertial quaternion output, is used as prime sensor during 3-axis stabilization and during the maneuver support modes. The accuracy of the star sensor is < 40 arcsec in all axes. In addition, there are two miniaturized gyros which are dynamically tuned. A GPS-based SPS (Satellite Positioning System) is used to provide the satellite position to an accuracy of < 30 m. Actuation is provided by magnetic torquers (momentum dumping), micro reaction wheels,and an RCS (Reaction Control Subsystem). The reaction wheels have aan angular momentum capacity of 0.36 Nms and a torque of 0.015 Nm. The wheels are arranged in a tetrahedral configuration to provide enhanced torques about any axis. The RCS consists of a single tank (8 liter volume) containing a monopropellant fuel and a single 1N thruster. The thruster is primarily used for orbit corrections.\n\nBMU (Bus Management Unit): The BMU represents the heart of the satellite providing the functions of telecommand decoding, house keeping telemetry, data encoding, sensor processing, on/off control of the subsystems and heaters, command distribution, spacecraft control during initial acquisition, normal mode, safe mode etc., using the actuators. This subsystem is realized in a single PCB (Printed Circuit Board).\n\nPassive control methods (with elements like multi layer insulation blankets, optical surface reflectors, thermal paints and heaters wherever necessary.) are being used in the thermal control subsystem. \n\nLaunch: A launch of IMS-1 as a secondary payload on a PSLV vehicle (PSLV-C9) took place on April 28, 2008 from the SDSC-SHAR launch site (Sriharikota, India) of ISRO. The primary payload on this flight was CartoSat-2A (launch mass of 690 kg), an Indian military high-resolution panchromatic imaging satellite (based on CartoSat-2 of ISRO).\n\nTWSat carries two payloads: the Mx-T (Multispectral Camera) and the HySI (Hyperspectral Imager). However, since the data of both imagers is rather high, only one of them will be powered on and data transmitted at any given time.\n\nMx-T (Multispectral Camera). The instrument of modular design provides four spectral bands in VNIR, where each band employs an individual lens, a separate CCD detector, and separate front-end electronics. The camera operates in a pushbroom scanning mode to image the Earth. The spatial resolution at nadir is 36 m on a swath of 151 km. The 12 bit video output is coded to 10 bit with multi-linear gain. Mx-T has a mass of 5.5 kg and a power consumption of 18 W.\n\nAll the front end electronics and the video processors are accommodated on the electro optical module (EOM) itself. Each band has one detector which gives out data in 4 ports with 10 bits per pixel. The source data (32 Mbit/s) is sent to the baseband data handling system of the microsatellite bus, compressed and stored in SSR (Solid State Recorder). The recorded data is transmitted to the ground in S-band at 8 Mbit/s. \n\nHySI-T (Hyperspectral Imager). The prototype instrument providing a total of 64 spectral bands in the VNIR region. Spectral separation is realized using the wedge filter technique. Detection is provided with a CMOS/APS (Active Pixel Sensor) area device. - The HySI-T data may be used for resource characterization and detailed studies. The HySI-T is being used on an experimental basis to obtain experience of such a payload and also of handling the hyperspectral data and generating the application models.\n\nMission operations: While Mx-T serves the basic requirement of the imaging mission, the HySI-T is incorporated on an experimental basis. It is planned to operate the Mx-T instrument on for most of the orbits based on the user demands, while the HySI-T is operated over Indian ground stations for evaluation purposes. Either of the payloads will be operated at a time in order to conserve the available resources on board the microsatellite.\n\nThe data from the two payloads is being downlinked separately. The Mx-T data is compressed at a ratio of 3.4:1, formatted, RS (Reed Solomon) encoded and stored on SSR (Solid Sate Recorder). The downlink is in near real-time via the S-band transmitter. The SSR has the storage capacity of 16 Gbit providing a maximum storage volume of 20 minutes data in segmented form. \n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: IMS-1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: IMS-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: MX-T\n      Short_Name: CCD IMAGER\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 635 km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 98 km\n      Period: 97.3 minutes\n      Perigee: 626.5 km\n      Apogee: 646.3 km\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-06-27\n   Online_Resource: http://directory.eoportal.org/get_announce.php?an_id=15158\n   Sample_Image: http://directory.eoportal.org/presentations/6100/IMS1_Auto9.jpeg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2008-04-28\n      Launch_Site: Sriharikota Island, India\n      Primary_Sponsor: Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "SOLRAD-7B": {"short_name": "SOLRAD-7B", "long_name": "Solar Radiation-7B", "description": "The Solar Radiation (SOLRAD) series 1, 4, 6 - 10 collected solar X-ray\nand ultraviolet data during numerous intervals in the years 1960 -\n1973.\n\nGeneral Information:\n\nDesignation: 01291 / 65016D\nLaunch date: 9 Mar 1965\nCountry of origin: United States\nMission: Scientific\nPerigee/Apogee: 900/928 km\nInclination: 70.1\u00b0\nPeriod: 103.3 min\nLaunch vehicle: Thor Agena D\nLaunch site:  Vandenberg\n\n[Summary provided by The Satellite Encyclopedia]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: SOLRAD-7B\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Solar/Space Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: SOLRAD\n      Short_Name: SOLRAD-7B\n      Long_Name: Solar Radiation-7B\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: solrad-7B\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: SXP\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Inclination: 70.1 degrees\n      Period: 103.3 minutes\n      Perigee: 900 km\n      Apogee: 928 km\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-01-14\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1965-016D\n   Sample_Image: http://www.astronautix.com/graphics/z/zgrab.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1965-03-09\n      Launch_Site: Vandenberg Air Force Base, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: United States Department of Defense\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "TSX": {"short_name": "TSX", "long_name": "TerraSAR-X", "description": "[Source: ASTRIUM GEOInformation Services, http://www.infoterra.de/terrasar-x-satellite ]\n\nTerraSAR-X was successfully launched on June 15th, 2007, from Baikonur in Kazakhstan and has been fully operational since early 2008.\n\nWith its active antenna, the spacecraft acquires high-quality X-band radar images of the entire planet whilst circling Earth in a polar orbit at 514 km altitude.

In\ngeneral, the spacecraft design, instrumentation, and operation were\nsimilar to SMS/GOES.  The cylindrically shaped spacecraft measured 210\ncm in diameter and 430 cm in length, including the apogee boost motor.\nThe primary structural members were an equipment platform and a\ncentral tube. The radiometer telescope was mounted on the equipment\nplatform and viewed the earth through a special aperture in the side\nof the spacecraft. A support structure extended radially out from the\ncentral tube and was affixed to the solar panels, which formed the\nouter walls of the spacecraft and provided the primary source of\nelectrical power.  Located in the annulus-shaped space between the\ncentral tube and the solar panels were station-keeping and dynamics\ncontrol equipment and batteries. Proper spacecraftattitude and spin\nrate (approximately 100 rpm) were maintained by jet thrusters mounted\non the spacecraft and activated by ground command. The spacecraft used\nboth UHF-band and S-band frequencies in its telemetry and command\nsubsystems.  A low-power VHF transponder provided telemetry and\ncommand during launch and then served as a backup for the primary\nsubsystem once the spacecraft attained synchronous orbit.\nThe spin-stabilized spacecraft carried (1) a visible-IR radiometer to\nprovide high-quality day/night cloudcover data and to take radiance\ntemperatures of the earth/atmosphere system, and (2) a meteorological\ndata collection system to disseminate image data to user stations, to\ncollect data from various earth-based platforms, and to relay data\nfrom polar-orbiting satellites.  Meteosat-1 was originally placed in a\ngeosynchronous orbit near the prime meridian and was positioned later\nbetween 9 and 11 degrees East.\nFor information on the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Meteosat\nProgram, see the URL: \"http://www.esrin.esa.it\"\n----------------\nEntry taken from:\nTaken from the NSSDC System for Information Retrieval and Storage (SIRS).

This program, previously known as DAPP (Data Acquisition and Processing Program), was classified until March 1973. The objective of this program is to provide global visual and infrared cloudcover data and specialized environmental data to support Department of Defense operational weather analysis and forecasting requirements. Operationally, the program consists of two satellites in sun-synchronous polar orbits, with the ascending node of one satellite in early morning and the other at local noon. The 6.4-m-long spacecraft is separated into four sections: (1) a precision mounting platform for sensors and equipment requiring precise alignment; (2) an equipment support module containing the electronics, reaction wheels, and some meteorological sensors; (3) a reaction control equipment support structure containing the third-stage rocket motor and supporting the ascent phase reaction control equipment; and (4) a 9.29-sq-m solar cell panel. The spacecraft stabilization is controlled by a combination flywheel and magnetic control coil system so that sensors are maintained in the desired earth-looking mode. One feature is the precision-pointing accuracy of the primary imager to 0.01 deg provided by a star sensor and an updated ephemeris navigation system. This allows automatic geographical mapping of the digital imagery to the nearest picture element. The operational linescan system is the primary data acquisition system that provides real-time or stored, multi-orbit, day-and-night, visual and infrared imagery of clouds. A supplementary sensor package contains five special sensors: (1) a microwave temperature sounder, (2) an advanced X-ray detector, (3) an ionospheric/scintillation monitor, (4) a precipitating electron/ion spectrometer, and (5) a microwave imager. Either recorded or real-time data are transmitted to ground-receiving sites by two redundant S-band transmitters. Recorded data are read out to tracking sites located at Fairchild AFB, Washington, and at Loring AFB, Maine, and relayed by SATCOM to Air Force Global Weather Central, Offutt AFB, Nebraska. Real-time data are read out at mobile tactical sites located around the world. Additional information concerning this satellite can be found in the report by D. A.

Although Boeing had pointed the way to the modern all-metal airliner in 1933 with the 247, it was Douglas that, more than any other company, made the promise a reality. Douglas produced a succession of piston-engined commercial aircraft through the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s: 138 DC-2s, 10,928 DC-3s (mostly for military service in World War II), 1453 DC-4s, 537 DC-6s and 226 DC-7s.\n\nGiven the success of their designs, Douglas took the view that there was no reason to rush into anything new, as did their rivals Lockheed and Convair. Most air transport manufacturers expected that there would be a gradual switch, from piston engines to turbines and that it would be to the more fuel-efficient turboprop engines rather than pure jets.\n\nIn contrast, Boeing took the bold step of starting to plan a pure jet airliner as early as 1949. Boeing's military arm had gained extensive experience with large, long-range jets through the B-47 Stratojet (first flight 1947) and the B-52 Stratofortress (1952). With thousands of their big jet bombers on order or in service, Boeing had developed a close relationship with the U.S. Air Force Strategic Air Command (SAC), and could count on having preference when the time came to replace SAC's fleet of piston-engined KC-97 Stratotankers. For Boeing, this was an opportunity to build a jet aircraft for air-to-air refueling that could be turned into a commercial transport.\n\n[Text provided by: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_DC-8 ]\n\n[Photo provided by: http://www.aerospaceweb.org/ ]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: DC-8\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Aircraft\n      Short_Name: DC-8\n      Long_Name: Douglas DC-8\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: CAPS\n      Short_Name: PRESSURE TRANSDUCERS\n      Short_Name: TEMPERATURE PROBES\n      Short_Name: PITOT-STATIC SYSTEM\n      Short_Name: INS\n      Short_Name: ROSEMOUNT PROBES\n      Short_Name: CDP\n      Short_Name: PIP\n      Short_Name: DC8 DROPSONDES\n      Short_Name: DROPSONDES\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-14\n   Online_Resource: http://www1.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/FactSheets/FS-050-DFRC.html\n   Sample_Image: http://www.aerospaceweb.org/aircraft/jetliner/dc8/dc8_06.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "G-IV": {"short_name": "G-IV", "long_name": "GULFSTREAM IV", "description": "The Gulfstream IV-SP (G-IV) is a high altitude, high speed, twin turbofan jet aircraft acquired by AOC in 1996.

The Apollo 17 lunar module also carried the  name of Challenger. Like her historic predecessors, Space  Shuttle Challenger and her crews made significant contributions  to America's scientific growth.\n\nChallenger started out as a high-fidelity structural test  article (STA-099). The airframe was completed by Rockwell and  delivered to Lockheed Plant 42 for structural testing on  02/04/78. The orbiter structure had evolved under such  weight-saving pressure that virtually all components of the air  frame were required to handle significant structural  stress. With such an optimized design, it was difficult to  accurately predict mechanical and thermal loading with the  computer software available at the time. The only safe approach  was to submit the structural test article to intensive testing  and analysis. STA-099 underwent 11 months of intensive  vibration testing in a 43 ton steel rig built especially for  the Space Shuttle Test Program. The rig consisted of 256  hydraulic jacks, distributed over 836 load application  points. Under computer control, it was possible to simulate the  expected stress levels of launch, ascent, on-orbit, reentry and  landing. Three 1 million pound-force hyd raulic cylinders were  used to simulate the thrust from the Space Shuttle Main  Engines. Heating and thermal simulations were also done.  On  January 28, 1986, the Challenger and its seven-member crew were  lost 73 seconds after launch when a booster failure resulted in  the breakup of the vehicle.\n\n[Summary provided by NASA]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: OV-099\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Space Stations/Manned Spacecraft\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: SPACE SHUTTLE\n      Short_Name: OV-099\n      Long_Name: Challenger Space Shuttle\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: challenger\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-01-24\n   Online_Resource: http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/shuttle/resources/orbiters/challenger.html\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "ERS-2": {"short_name": "ERS-2", "long_name": "European Remote Sensing Satellite-2", "description": "The second European Remote Sensing Satellite ERS-2, launched on 20\nApril 1995, operates in a sun-synchronous, near-polar orbit at an\naltitude of 785 km and an inclination of 98.5 degrees ,known as the\nreference orbit.

This program, previously known as DAPP (Data Acquisition and Processing Program), was classified until March 1973. The objective of this program is to provide global visual and infrared cloudcover data and specialized environmental data to support Department of Defense operational weather analysis and forecasting requirements. Operationally, the program consists of two satellites in sun-synchronous polar orbits, with the ascending node of one satellite in early morning and the other at local noon.\n\nThe 6.4-m-long spacecraft is separated into four sections: (1) a precision mounting platform for sensors and equipment requiring precise alignment; (2) an equipment support module containing the electronics, reaction wheels, and some meteorological sensors; (3) a reaction control equipment support structure containing the third-stage rocket motor and supporting the ascent phase reaction control equipment; and (4) a 9.29-sq-m solar cell panel. The spacecraft stabilization is controlled by a combination flywheel and magnetic control coil system so that sensors are maintained in the desired earth-looking mode. One feature is the precision-pointing accuracy of the primary imager to 0.01 deg provided by a star sensor and an updated ephemeris navigation system. This allows automatic geographical mapping of the digital imagery to the nearest picture element.\n\nThe operational linescan system is the primary data acquisition system and provides real-time or stored, multi-orbit, day-and-night, visual and infrared imagery of clouds. A supplementary sensor package contains: (1) a microwave imager; (2) a microwave temperature sounder; (3) a microwave water vapor profiler; (4) an ion and electron scintillation monitor; (5) a precipitating electron/ion spectrometer; (6) a gamma/X-ray detector; (7) a magnetometer; and (8) a static earth-viewing sensor monitoring electromagnetic radiation.\n\nAdditional information concerning the satellite can be found in the report by D.

Today it remains popular with freight operators.\n\nThe Lockheed L-188 Electra was developed to meet a 1954 American Airlines requirement for a domestic short to medium range 75 to 100 seat airliner. In June 1955 American awarded Lockheed an order for 35 such aircraft. Lockheed's design, the L-188, was a low wing, four turboprop powered aircraft. Many other airlines shared American's interest in the L-188, and by the time the first prototype flew on December 6 1957, the order book stood at 144. Service entry was with Eastern Airlines (due to a pilot's strike at American) on January 12 1959.\n\nHowever, any optimism Lockheed felt about a strong sales future would have been short lived, as a number of crashes in 1959 and 1960 (two of which where the aircraft broke up in flight) contributed to a number of order cancellations.\n\nAs an interim measure following the crashes, speed restrictions were imposed on Electras. Investigations uncovered a design defect with the engine mountings where the wing would shake and eventually break up. Lockheed undertook a significant modification program where the nacelles, nacelle mountings and wing structure were strengthened, and the speed restrictions were eventually lifted in 1961. After that the Electra proved reliable and popular in service, but the damage had been done and production wound up in 1961 after 170 had been built.\n\nLockheed built two basic versions of the Electra. The L-188A was the basic production aircraft, and accounted for most Electra sales. The L-188C entered service with KLM in 1959 and had greater fuel capacity and higher weights, and thus improved payload range performance.\n\nThe Electra also forms the basis for the hugely successful P-3 Orion long range maritime surveillance aircraft of which more than 600 have been built.\n\nMost Electras currently in service are configured as freighters. From 1967 Lockheed converted 41 Electras to freighters or convertible freighter/passenger aircraft, fitting a strengthened floor and a large cargo door forward of the wing on the left side. Other companies have also converted Electras to freighters. However, a small number remain in passenger service. \n\n[Text provided by airliners.net: http://www.airliners.net/aircraft-data/stats.main?id=268 ]\n\n[Photo provided by: http://quest.arc.nasa.gov/ltc/astrobio/leonid/images/NCAR.gif ]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: NASA ELECTRA\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Aircraft\n      Short_Name: NASA ELECTRA\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-14\n   Online_Resource: http://www.airliners.net/aircraft-data/stats.main?id=268\n   Sample_Image: http://quest.arc.nasa.gov/ltc/astrobio/leonid/images/NCAR.gif\nEnd_Group"}, "NCEP/NCAR-RM": {"short_name": "NCEP/NCAR-RM", "long_name": "NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis Model"}, "Galileo (Europe's European Satellite Navigation System)": {"short_name": "Galileo (Europe's European Satellite Navigation System)", "description": "Galileo is the European Union's Global Satellite Navigation System (GNSS).

For understanding tropical meteorological and climatic processes, it appeared necessary to obtain reliable statistics on the water and energy budget of the tropical atmosphere and to describe the evolution of its systems (monsoons, cyclones, \u2026) at appropriate time scales. In parallel, tropical atmospheric and oceanic missions were also studied in India, which is directly concerned by these phenomena. The first originality of MEGHA-TROPIQUES is to associate three radiometric instruments allowing to observe simultaneously three interrelated components of the atmospheric engine : water vapour, condensed water (clouds and precipitations), and radiative fluxes. The second is to privilege the sampling of the intertropical zone, accounting for the large time-space variability of the tropical phenomena. Moreover, the MEGHA-TROPIQUES microwave radiometer MADRAS could be one element complementing the constellation of mini-satellites of the Global Precipitation Mission .\nScientific objectives\n\n- to improve the knowledge of the water cycle in the intertropical region, to evaluate its consequences on the energy budget,\n\n- to study the life cycle of tropical convective systems over ocean and continents, the environmental conditions for their appearance and evolution, their water budget, and the associated transports of water vapor.\nApplied objectives\n\n- to provide data about the processes leading to dramatic weather events affecting the Tropical countries, as hurricanes, systems producing heavy rainfalls, processes governing monsoons variability or droughts.\nMission Scenario\n\nThe key of this mission is the repetitivity of the measurement in the Tropics. The orbit of the platform must be in a low inclination on the equatorial plane. The altitude of the orbit has to be high enough to allow a wide swath of the instruments.\nGeophysical parameters to be retrieved:\n\nAtmospheric water cycle elements: Water vapor (integrated and vertical distribution), cloud condensed water content, ice/water, precipitation.\n\nRadiative budget elements: solar reflected and terrestrial emitted fluxes at the top of the atmosphere.\nInstrumental payload\n\nThe instruments have to be complementary to what exists on geostationary satellites (VIS-IR imagers). Microwave instruments are then fundamental. The main payload instruments are:\n\n- A microwave imager (MADRAS) aimed mainly to study precipitation and cloud properties, including ice at the top of clouds (SSM/I type, with an additional channel at 157 GHz).\n\n- A microwave sounding instrument for the atmospheric water vapor (SAPHIR - 6 channels in the 183 GHz band).\n\n- A radiometer devoted to the measurement of outgoing radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere (ScaRaB).\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: MEGHA-TROPIQUES\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: MEGHA-TROPIQUES\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: SAPHIR\n      Short_Name: MADRAS\n      Short_Name: SCARAB\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 867\n      Orbit_Inclination: 20\n      Period: 102.16 minutes\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > LOW EARTH ORBIT > INCLINED NON-POLAR\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2012-01-20\n   Online_Resource: http://meghatropiques.ipsl.polytechnique.fr/mission-description.html\n   Sample_Image: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/72/Megha_tropiques.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2011-10-12\n      Launch_Site: SRIHARIKOTA ISLAND, INDIA\n      Design_Life: 4\n      Primary_Sponsor: Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)\n      Primary_Sponsor: Centre National d'\u00c9tudes Spatiales (CNES)\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "PALACE FLOAT": {"short_name": "PALACE FLOAT", "long_name": "Profiling Autonomous Lagrangian Circulation Explorer", "description": "PALACE FLOATS measure profiles of ocean salinity and temperature.

As the most advanced gravity space mission to date, GOCE will realise a broad range of fascinating new possibilities for oceanography, solid Earth physics, geodesy and sea-level research, and significantly contribute to furthering our understanding of climate change.  \n \nAlthough invisible, gravity is a complex force of nature that has an immeasurable impact on our everyday lives. It is often assumed that the force of gravity on the surface of the Earth has a constant value, but in fact the value of 'g' varies subtly from place to place. These variations are due to a number of factors such as the rotation of the Earth, the position of mountains and ocean trenches and variations in density of the Earth's interior.\n\nOver its life of about 20 months, GOCE will map these global variations in the gravity field with extreme detail and accuracy. This will result in a unique model of the 'geoid', which is the surface of equal gravitational potential defined by the gravity field \u2013 crucial for deriving accurate measurements of ocean circulation and sea-level change, both of which are affected by climate change. GOCE-derived data are also much needed to understand more about processes occurring inside the Earth and for use in practical applications such as surveying and levelling.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: GOCE\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: Earth Explorers\n      Short_Name: GOCE\n      Long_Name: Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: LRR\n      Short_Name: EGG\n      Short_Name: SSTI\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 250 km (Hibernation 270 km)\n      Orbit_Inclination: 96.7\u00b0\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2009-05-15\n   Online_Resource: http://www.esa.int/esaLP/LPgoce.html\n   Online_Resource: http://ilrs.gsfc.nasa.gov/satellite_missions/list_of_satellites/goce_general.html\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2009-03-17\n      Launch_Site: Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia\n      Design_Life: 20 months\n      Primary_Sponsor: ESA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "SPOT-6": {"short_name": "SPOT-6", "long_name": "Systeme Probatoire Pour l'Observation de la Terre-6", "description": "TECHNICAL FEATURES\nWith SPOT 6 and SPOT 7, Astrium not only secures mission continuity of the SPOT series, which has been\ncollecting an archive of more than 30 million of scenes since 1986: this new generation of optical satellites also\nfeatures technological improvements and advanced system performance that increase reactivity and\nacquisition capacity as well as simplifying data access.\n\nSpace segment:\nSPOT 6 and SPOT 7 will provide 1.5metre resolution products over broad areas until 2024.\nNumber of satellites 2\nLaunch periods\nSPOT 6: September 12th, 2012\nSPOT 7: June 30th, 2014\nDesign lifetime 10 years\nSize Body: ~ 1.55 x 1.75 x 2.7 m\nSolar array wingspan 5,4 m2\nLaunch mass 712 kg\nAltitude 694 km\nOnboard Storage 1 Tbits end of life (Solid State Mass Memory)\n\nOrbital characteristics and viewing capability:\nSPOT 6 and SPOT 7 missions are designed to achieve efficiently both collection of large coverage and collection\nof individual targets that are possible thanks to the extreme agility of the satellite.\nOrbit Sun-synchronous; 10:00 AM local time at descending node\nPeriod 98.79 minutes\nCycle 26 days\nViewing angle Standard: +/- 30\u00b0 in roll | Extended: +/- 45\u00b0 in roll\nRevisit\n\u2022 1 day with SPOT 6 and SPOT 7 operating simultaneously\n\u2022 Between 1 and 3 days with only one satellite in operation (note 1)\nPointing agility\nControl Moment Gyroscopes allowing quick maneuvers in all\ndirections for targeting several areas of interest on the same pass (30\u00b0\nin 14s, including stabilization time)\nAcquisition capacity Up to 6 million sq.km daily with SPOT 6 and SPOT 7 when operating\nsimultaneously\nNominal Imaging Mode 60km-swath strips oriented along North-South axis; up to 600km\nlength\nStereo capability Fore and aft mode; Single pass stereo and tri-stereo\n\nNote1: Depends on the latitude of the area of interest\n\nInstruments:\nOptical system One instrument made of 2 identical Korsch telescopes, each with a 200\nmm aperture, delivering the expected swath.\nDetectors PAN array assembly: 28,000 pixels\nMS array assembly: 4 x 7000 pixels\nSpectral bands\nPanchromatic: 0.450-0.745 \u00b5m\nBlue: 0.450-0.520 \u00b5m\nGreen: 0.530-0.590 \u00b5m\nRed: 0.625-0.695 \u00b5m\nNear Infrared: 0.760-0.890 \u00b5m\nThe 5 bands are always acquired simultaneously.\nSwath 60km at nadir\nDynamic range at acquisition 12 bits per pixel\nLocation accuracy specification\n\u2022 35m CE 90 without GCP within a 30\u00b0 viewing angle cone\n\u2022 10m CE90 for Ortho products where Reference3D is available\nInstrument telemetry link rate X-band channel - 300 Mbits/s\n\nGround segment:\nMain receiving stations\n\u2022 Toulouse (France)\n\u2022 Kiruna (Sweden)\nS-Band uplink stations\n\u2022 Kiruna (Sweden)\n\u2022 Inuvik (Canada)\nProgramming centre\nAstrium GEO-Information Service \u2013 Toulouse (France)\nAstrium GEO-Information Service \u2013 Chantilly VA (USA)\nProduction centre Astrium GEO-Information Service \u2013 Toulouse (France)\nTasking plans refresh frequency 6 times/day/satellite\nUpdate of weather forecast 4 times/day \u2013 fully automatic process\nSatellite control centre Astrium Satellite \u2013 Toulouse (France)"}, "STPSat-3": {"short_name": "STPSat-3", "long_name": "U.S. Air Force Space Test Program Satellite 3", "description": "STPSat-3 Mission:  Launched from Wallops Flight Center Va., on Nov. 19, 2013 \u2013 three years to the day since STPSat-2 launched from Kodiak, Alaska.\n\nSTPSat-3 is the primary satellite for the U.S. Air Force Operationally Responsive Space (ORS)-3 enabler mission.

UARS, the first satellite dedicated to studying stratospheric science, focuses on the processes that lead to ozone depletion, complementing and amplifying the measurements of total ozone made by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) onboard NASA's Nimbus-7 and the Russian Meteor-3 satellites. UARS also measures winds and temperatures in the stratosphere as well as the energy input from the Sun.  \n\nTen UARS instruments have provided the most complete data on upper atmospheric energy inputs, winds, and chemical composition ever gathered. Together, these observations constitute a highly integrated investigation of the nature of the upper atmosphere, and help define the role of the upper atmosphere in climate and climate variability. In its first two weeks of operation, UARS data confirmed the polar ozone-depletion theories by providing three-dimensional maps of ozone and chlorine monoxide near the South Pole during development of the 1991 ozone hole. UARS, developed and managed by GSFC, in Greenbelt, Md., provides information that nations around the world can use to guide decisions on environmental policies, according to scientists.  \n\nMoreover, UARS collected data on the chemistry, dynamics, and radiative inputs to the upper atmosphere far beyond its designed lifetime, obtaining over 13 years of observations for many atmospheric constituents, temperature, winds, and external forcings.  UARS was decommissioned in 2005. The United Kingdom and Canada both provided instruments for this mission.

This program, previously known as DAPP (Data Acquisition and Processing Program), was classified until March 1973. The objective of this program was to provide global visual and infrared cloudcover data and specialized environmental data to support Department of Defense requirements. Operationally, the program consisted of two satellites in planned 830-km, sun-synchronous polar orbits, with the ascending node of one satellite in early morning and the other one at local noon. The 6.4-m-long spacecraft was divided into four sections: (1) a precision mounting platform for sensors and equipment requiring precise alignment; (2) an equipment support module containing the electronics, reaction wheels, and some meteorological sensors; (3) a reaction control equipment support structure containing the third-stage rocket motor and supporting the ascent phase reaction control equipment; and (4) a 9.29-sq-m solar cell panel. The spacecraft stabilization was controlled by a combination flywheel and magnetic control coil system so sensors were maintained in the desired \"earth-looking\" mode. One feature was the precision-pointing accuracy of the primary imager to 0.01 deg provided by a star sensor and an updated ephemeris navigation system. This allowed automatic geographical mapping of the digital imagery to the nearest picture element. The operational linescan system was the primary data acquisition system that provided real-time or stored, multi-orbit, day-and-night, visual and infrared imagery of the clouds. A supplementary sensor package contained six special sensors: (1) a microwave temperature sounder, (2) an X-ray spectrometer, (3) an ionospheric plasma monitor, (4) a precipitating electron/ion spectrometer, (5) a magnetometer, and (6) a space radiation dosimeter. Either recorded or real-time data were transmitted to ground-receiving sites by two redundant S-band transmitters. Recorded data were read out to tracking sites located at Fairchild AFB, Washington, and at Loring AFB, Maine, and relayed by SATCOM to Air Force Global Weather Central, Offutt AFB, Nebraska. Real-time data were read out at mobile tactical sites located around the world. A more complete description of the satellite can be found in the report by D. A.

The only instrument on board is an imaging spectrometer with the ability to obtain high fidelity color movies of solar flares in X rays and gamma rays. It uses two new complementary technologies: fine grids to modulate the solar radiation, and germanium detectors to measure the energy of each photon very precisely. \n\nHESSI's imaging capability is achieved with fine tungsten and/or molybdenum grids that modulate the solar X-ray flux as the spacecraft rotates at ~ 15 rpm. Up to 20 detailed images can be obtained per second. This is sufficient to track the electrons as they travel from their acceleration site, believed to be in the solar corona, and slow down on their way to the lower solar atmosphere. \n\nThe high-resolution spectroscopy is achieved with 9 cooled germanium crystals that detect the X-ray and gamma-ray photons transmitted through the grids over the broad energy range of 3 keV to 20 MeV. Their fine energy resolution of about 1 keV is more than sufficient to reveal the detailed features of the X-ray and gamma-ray spectra, clues to the nature of the electron and ion acceleration processes. \n\nA spinning spacecraft pointing at or near Sun center provides a simple and reliable way to achieve the rotation required for the HESSI imaging technique. A low-altitude equatorial orbit that can be reached with a Pegasus launch vehicle is chosen to minimize damage to the germanium detectors from the charged particles in the Earth's radiation belts. \n\nContext observations from ground-based observatories and a theory program are also integral parts of the HESSI mission. Ground-based optical and radio telescopes will provide complementary data on the magnetic fields, electric currents, hot plasma, and the energetic electrons in the flaring regions where the X-ray and gamma-ray emissions are generated.

The solar cells served to charge the 63 nickel-cadmium batteries.\nThe two cameras were mounted 180-degrees opposite each other along the side of the cylindrical craft. The \"cartwheel\" configuration of the TIROS-9 was selected as the orbital configuration for the ESSA satellites. Therefore, a camera could be pointed at some point on Earth every time the satellite rotated along its axis. The spacecraft operating system was the same as on the TIROS-9.

The spacecraft was in a 24 hour orbit with an apoapsis of 66,900\nkm. Thereafter, the periapsis was allowed to rise (to 2290 km at maximum) and\nthen fall, to conserve fuel. In 1991 the Radar Mapper was reactivated to\ninvestigate previously inaccessible southern portions of the planet. In May\n1992 Pioneer Venus began the final phase of its mission, in which the periapsis\nwas held between 150 and 250 km until the fuel ran out and atmospheric entry\ndestroyed the spacecraft the following August. \n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: PIONEER VENUS\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Interplanetary Spacecraft\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: ORBITER\n      Short_Name: PIONEER VENUS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: PVO\n      Short_Name: Pioneer 12\n      Short_Name: Pioneer Venus 1\n      Short_Name: Pioneer Venus 1978 Orbiter\n      Short_Name: 10911\n      Short_Name: 1978-051A\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-02-05\n   Online_Resource: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/pioneer-venus/index.html\n   Sample_Image: http://agile.gsfc.nasa.gov/Images/pvo/pvo.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1978-05-20\n      Launch_Site: Cape Canaveral/Kennedy Space Center, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "LANDSAT-7": {"short_name": "LANDSAT-7", "description": "Landsat 7 systematically provides well-calibrated, multispectral, moderate resolution, substantially cloud-free, sun-lit digital images of the Earth&#039;s continental and coastal areas with global coverage on a seasonal basis.

(IAI). The overall objective is to launch and operate a constellation of high-resolution commercial satellites, primarily for intelligence and national security applications and to serve a global customer base. The spaceborne remote sensing technology for the EROS family was approved by the government of Israel in Oct. 1996. \n\nThe EROS program offers a combination of services and products tailored to meet specific customer requirements and budgets: \n\n\u2022 The option to acquire exclusive imaging rights over a defined footprint or the ability to acquire imagery on an exclusive basis.\n\n\u2022 Rapid delivery of imagery to the customer, either through direct downlink, electronic transfer or courier.\n\n\u2022 Provision of low-cost imagery products to support applications in many fields.\n\nSpacecraft:\n\nThe EROS-A satellite structure consists of low-mass composite material with passive thermal control, it is three-axis stabilized. Attitude control and navigation is performed using horizon sensors, sun sensors, gyros and magnetometer, four reaction wheels and thrusters. The pointing accuracy is <0.1\u00ba in all three axes, attitude stabilization is < 40 \u00b5rad/s, the jitter is < 0.2 \u00b5rad. S/C mass = 260 kg (178 kg S/C bus, 42 kg of instrument mass and 30 kg of hydrazine), solar panel power (silicon array, fixed panels) = 450 W (EOL), plus 14 Ah NiCd batteries for eclipse operation, the bus power consumption at imaging session is 300 W. S/C design life = 4 years, however the estimated operational life of the satellite is ten years. \n\nRF communications: Imagery is transmitted in X-band at a rate of 70 Mbit/s (RF downlink) to the ground receiving stations, using a 1.5 W transmitter and one of the two existing two-axis gimbaled directional antennas. The EROS satellites are monitored/operated in S-Band (TT&C) via a single ground control station (GCS), located at IAI/MBT in Israel (3 to 4 passes per day and per satellite are in station visibility). The S-band data rate is either 2.5 or 15 kbit/s selectable by the GCS.\n\nImageSat has a global network of ground segment infrastructure, for real-time image data acquisition. This network is comprised of the ImageSat Central Ground Control Station, a network of EROS-compatible Ground Receiving Stations on 5 continents and EROS-compatible Ground Control Stations based at exclusive customers' premises (see SOP Program).\n\nThe EROS A satellite has limited availability of onboard source data storage, as the satellite was designed to cater to customers acquiring real-time, exclusive imaging and download rights over a defined geographic footprint, in view of their own EROS-compatible GRS (Ground Receiving Stations).\n\nOperational capabilities/services primarily include:\n\n\u2022 Satellite Operating Partner (SOP) Program. This service provides a dedicated regional satellite with local customer tasking. SOP receiving ground stations are able to plan, to generate and to transmit imaging commands to the satellite and to download imagery in real-time.\n\n\u2022 PAS (Priority Acquisition Service) Program. The service provides highest priority tasking of the EROS satellite, in areas not previously acquired by SOP Customers.\n\n\u2022 Non-exclusive acquisitions. ImageSat sells EROS imagery on a non-exclusive basis to customers for civilian applications, such as mapping, disaster planning and monitoring, environmental management, homeland security and border control, and a range of development-related projects. \n\naunch: EROS-A was launched on a Russian Start-1 launcher on Dec. 5, 2000 from the Svobodny Cosmodrome in eastern Siberia.\n\nOrbit for EROS-A: Circular sun-synchronous orbit, altitude 480 km, inclination = 97.3\u00ba, period = 94.7 minutes, local time of descending node at 10:00 hours. The revisit capability at at latitude of 10\u00ba within a 15\u00ba cone is within 10.5 days. A revisit period/satellite at latitude of 10\u00ba is 4.5 days within a 30\u00ba cone, and only 2.5 days within a 45\u00ba cone.\n\nOperational status of mission: The EROS-A spacecraft and all subsystems are operating nominally as of 2008.

The name change took place in June 2000. ImageSat was re-incorporated in Curacao, Netherlands Antilles. ImageSat's ownership includes: Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) of Tel-Aviv (owned by the Israeli government), Elbit Systems Ltd. of Haifa, and private investors from Europe and the United States.\n\n\u2022 EROS-B was launched on April 25, 2006 on a Start-1 launch vehicle from the Svobodny Cosmodrome in eastern Siberia\n\n\u2022 A third satellite, EROS C, will offer comparable panchromatic resolution to EROS B, as well as multispectral resolution of 2.8 m GSD; it is planned for launch in 2009. \n\nInformation obtained from http://www.eoportal.org/\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: EROS-A1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: EROS-A1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: Earth Remote Observation System-A\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: CAMERAS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 480\n      Orbit_Inclination: 97.3\n      Period: 94.7\n      Perigee: 498.6\n      Apogee: 511.2\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-09\n   Online_Resource: http://directory.eoportal.org/get_announce.php?an_id=10063\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2000-12-05\n      Launch_Site: Svobodny Cosmodrome, Russia\n      Design_Life: 4 years\n      Primary_Sponsor: ImageSat International, Israel\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "SMS-2": {"short_name": "SMS-2", "long_name": "Synchronous Meteorological Satellite 2", "description": "SMS-2 was launched in February 1975 and was a NASA-developed, NOAA-operated, second prototype spacecraft for the geosynchronous series of meteorological satellites.  The cylindrically shaped spacecraft measured 190.5 cm in diameter and 230 cm in length, exclusive of a magnetometer that extended an additional 83 cm beyond the cylinder shell.  The primary structural members were a honeycombed equipment shelf and thrust tube.  The VISSR telescope was mounted on the equipment shelf and viewed the Earth through a special aperture in the side of the spacecraft.  A support structure extended radially from the thrust tube and was affixed to the solar panels, which formed the outer walls of the spacecraft and provided the primary source of electrical power.  Located in the annulus-shaped space between the thrust tube and the solar panels were stationkeeping and dynamics control equipment, batteries, and most of the SEM equipment.  Proper spacecraft attitude and spin rate (approximately 100 rpm) were maintained by two separate sets of jet thrusters mounted around the spacecraft equator and activated by ground command.  The spacecraft used both UHF-band and S-band frequencies in its telemetry and command subsystem.  A low-power VHF transponder provided telemetry and command during launch and then served as a backup for the primary subsystem once the spacecraft attained orbit. This spin-stabilized spacecraft carried a visible infrared spin-scan radiometer, meteorological data collection and relay system, space environment monitor, and a biaxial fluxgate magnetometer.  Throughout its history, it operated at 75 (replaced SMS-1 in April 1979), 115, and 135 degrees West.\n__________\nTaken from the NSSDC System for Information Retrieval and Storage (SIRS).

This program, previously known as DAPP (Data Acquisition and Processing Program), was classified until March 1973. The objectives of this program were to provide global visual and infrared cloud cover data and specialized environmental data to support Department of Defense requirements. Operationally, the program consisted of two satellites in planned 830-km sun-synchronous polar orbits, with the ascending node of one satellite in early morning and the other at local noon. The 5.4-m long spacecraft was separated into four sections: (1) a precision mounting platform (PMP) for sensors and equipment requiring precise alignment, (2) an equipment support module (ESM) containing the electronics, reaction wheels, and some meteorological sensors, (3) a reaction control equipment (RCE) support structure (that has the third-stage motor, hydrazine reaction control system) which supports (4) a 9.29 sq mm solar cell panel. The spacecraft stabilization was controlled by a combination flywheel and magnetic control coil system so sensors could be maintained in the desired `earth-looking' mode. One feature was the precision-pointing accuracy of the primary imager to 0.01 deg provided by a star sensor and an updated ephemeris navigation system. This allowed automatic geographical mapping of the digital imagery to the nearest picture element. The operational line scan system (OLS) built by Westinghouse, was the primary data acquisition system that provided real-time or stored, multi-orbit, day-and-night visual and infrared imagery at 1/3-nautical-mile resolution for all major land masses, 1-1/2-nautical-mile resolution for complete global coverage, and provided with this data calibration, timing, and other auxiliary signals to the spacecraft for digital transmission to the ground. A supplementary sensor package, the special sensor H (SSH), a step-scanning radiometer, was the infrared temperature-humidity-ozone sounder. The data processing system, which included three high-density tape recorders, was capable of storing a total of 400 min of data, each allowing full global coverage twice daily. Either recorded or real-time data were transmitted to ground-receiving sites via two redundant S-band transmitters. Recorded data were read out to tracking sites located at Fairchild AFB, WA, and Loring AFB, ME, and relayed via SATCOM to Air Force Global Weather Central, Offutt AFB, NE. Real-time data were read out at mobile tactical sites located around the world.

This increased the spacecraft launch mass to about 350 kg. \n\nOrbit: Sun-synchronous circular orbit, mean altitude = 500 km, inclination = 97.4\u00ba, local time of descending node (LTDN) at 14:00 hours. - Note: The orbits of EROS-A and EROS-B are phased in the same orbital plane thereby increasing the revisit time of the constellation.\n\nLaunch: A launch of EROS-B took place on April 25, 2006 on a Start-1 launch vehicle from the Svobodny Cosmodrome in eastern Siberia (location at: 51.4\u00ba N, 128.3\u00ba E). 3)\n\nRF communications: Imagery is transmitted in X-band at a rate of 280 Mbit/s (downlink) to the ground receiving stations, using a 1.5 W transmitter and one of the two existing two-axis gimbaled directional antennas. The EROS satellites are monitored/operated in S-Band (TT&C) via a single ground control station (GCS), located at IAI/MBT in Israel (3 to 4 passes per day and per satellite are in station visibility). The S-band data rate is either 2.5 or 15 kbit/s selectable by the GCS.\n\nImageSat has a global network of ground segment infrastructure, for real-time image data acquisition. This network is comprised of the ImageSat Central Ground Control Station, a network of EROS-compatible Ground Receiving Stations on 5 continents and EROS-compatible Ground Control Stations based at exclusive customers' premises. \n\nSensor complement: (PIC-2)\n\nPIC-2 (Panchromatic Imaging Camera-2), designed and developed by ElOp (Electro Optical Industries) of Rehovot, Israel, a subsidiary of Elbit Systems Ltd. The EROS-B series imager instrument features CCD pushbroom technology in combination with a TDI (Time Delay Integration) scheme in its focal plane, a cumulative expose concept of each ground image line by a CCD detector array, to improve the SNR value (an important issue for high-resolution imaging). The instrument uses also a Cassegrain telescope with an aperture of 50 cm in diameter and a focal length of 5 m (folded optics). FOV = 1.5\u00ba. The PIC-2 instrument is rigidly mounted to the S/C structure looking into the nadir direction, thus permitting a body-pointing observation scheme. \n\nhe CCD pushbroom detector array provides 10,000 pixels per line and a total of 96 lines for selectable TDI observation support. Pushbroom scanning is provided for panchromatic imagery only in the spectral range of 0.5 - 0.9 \u03bcm. The ground sampling distance (GSD) is 0.70 m, the swath width is 7 km at nadir. The data is quantized at 10 bit/sample.\n\nThe imager instrument of EROS-B spacecraft can be operated in either asynchronous or in synchronous imaging mode. In synchronous mode, the S/C platform keeps a constant pointing angle toward the Earth's surface. In asynchronous mode, imaging by the detector array is performed in a \"step-and-stare\" fashion, i.e., by slewing the S/C platform in the along-track direction (this permits in particular the generation of mosaics as well as the support of stereo imaging of targets of interest).\n\nInformation obtained from http://www.eoportal.org/\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: EROS-B1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: EROS-B1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: CAMERAS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 500\n      Orbit_Inclination: 97.4\n      Period: 94.7\n      Perigee: 503.5\n      Apogee: 514.7\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-09\n   Online_Resource: http://directory.eoportal.org/get_announce.php?an_id=12460\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2006-04-25\n      Launch_Site: Svobodny Cosmodrome, Russia\n      Design_Life: 10 years\n      Primary_Sponsor: ImageSat International, Israel\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "YOHKOH": {"short_name": "YOHKOH", "description": "The YOHKOH satellite, also called \"Sunbeam\" was launched into\nspace from the Kagoshima Space Center (KSC) in Southern\nJapan.

The total solar irradiance was\nmeasured by ACRIM, gamma rays by GRS, hard X-rays by the HXRBS, soft\nX-rays by XRP and HXIS, ultraviolet by UVSP, and the C/P imaged the\ncorona 2-5 radii from the sun.

Observations of surface deformation are used to forecast the likelihood of earthquakes occurring as a function of location, as well as predicting both the place and time that volcanic eruptions and landslides are likely. Advances in earthquake science leading to improved time-dependent probabilities would be significantly facilitated by global observations of surface deformation, and could result in significant increases in the health and safety of the public due to decreased exposure to tectonic hazards. Monitoring surface deformation is also important for improving the safety and efficiency of extraction of hydrocarbons, for managing our ground water resources, and, in the future, providing information for managing CO2 sequestration.\n\nMission Objectives\n\n- Determine the likelihood of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and landslides.\n- Predict the response of ice sheets to climate change and impact on the sea level.\n- Characterize the effects of changing climate and land use on species habitats and carbon budget.\n- Monitor the migration of fluids associated with hydrocarbon production and groundwater resources.\n\nThis mission combines two sensors that, taken together, provide observations important for solid-Earth (surface deformation), ecosystems (terrestrial biomass structure) and climate (ice dynamics). The sensors are: 1) an L-band Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) system with multiple polarization, and 2) a multiple beam lidar operating in the infrared (~ 1064 nm) with ~ 25 m spatial resolution and 1 m vertical accuracy. The mission using InSAR to meet the science measurement objectives for surface deformation, ice sheet dynamics, and ecosystem structure has been extensively studied. It requires a satellite in 700-800 km sun-synchronous orbit in order to maximize available power from the solar arrays. An eight day revisit frequency balances temporal de-correlation with required coverage. Onboard GPS achieves cm-level orbit and baseline knowledge to improve calibration. The mission should have a 5 year life time to capture time-variable processes and achieve measurement accuracy.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: DESDYNI\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: DESDYNI\n      Long_Name: Deformation, Ecosystem Structure and Dynamics of Ice\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2009-02-25\n   Online_Resource: http://decadal.gsfc.nasa.gov/desdyni.html\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "SOLRAD-8": {"short_name": "SOLRAD-8", "long_name": "Solar Radiation-8", "description": "The NRL Solrad 8 satellite was one of the Solrad series that\nbegan in 1960 to provide continuous coverage of solar radiation\nwith a set of standard photometers.

The T-39 Sabreliner is a low wing, twin jet aircraft. The cockpit and cabin compartments are pressurized and soundproofed for high altitude flight. Power is supplied by two Pratt and Whitney, J60 gas turbine engines located on each side of the aft fuselage. The rated sea level static thrust of each engine is 3,000 pounds at military power.\n\nThe T-39 was developed by North American Aviation Inc. as a private venture to meet a USAF requirement for a twin jet utility trainer. The prototype T-39 made its first flight on September 16, 1958. In January 1959, the USAF placed a production order and on June 30, 1960, the first production T-39A made its initial flight. In all, 143 T-39As and 6 T-39Bs were built for the USAF.\n\nAnother 62 T-39 variants were produced for the Navy. In July 1961, the Navy ordered ten of North American\u2019s Model NA-277 to train radar operators. In that order the aircraft was designated T3J-1, but by the time the first one was delivered in 1962, the designation had been changed to T-39D. A total of 52 additional aircraft were accepted. After the bulk of military contracts had been met, the Sabreliner entered the commercial market where it became a highly successful executive jet transport. \n\n[Text provided by: http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/ct-39.htm ]\n\n[Photo provided by: http://wikipedia.org ] \n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: T-39\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Aircraft\n      Short_Name: T-39\n      Long_Name: Rockwell Sabreliner T-39\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-14\n   Online_Resource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Sabreliner\n   Sample_Image: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/T39_mainlarge_cnatra_navy.jpg\nEnd_Group"}, "GEOS-2": {"short_name": "GEOS-2", "long_name": "Geodetic Earth Orbiting Satellite-2", "description": "Spacecraft Brief Description\n  The   GEOS   2   (Geodetic   Earth   Orbiting   Satellite)   was  a\n  gravity-gradient-stabilized,    solar-cell-powered   spacecraft   that\n  carried   electronic   and  geodetic  instrumentation.

Its pre-launch designation was DMSP 5D-2/S9. This program, previously known as DAPP (Data Acquisition and Processing Program), was classified until March 1973. The objective of this program is to provide global visual and infrared cloudcover data and specialized environmental data to support Department of Defense operational weather analysis and forecasting requirements. Operationally, the program consists of two satellites in sun-synchronous polar orbits, with the ascending node of one satellite in early morning and the other at local noon. The 6.4-m-long spacecraft is separated into four sections: (1) a precision mounting platform for sensors and equipment requiring precise alignment; (2) an equipment support module containing the electronics, reaction wheels, and some meteorological sensors; (3) a reaction control equipment support structure containing the third-stage rocket motor and supporting the ascent phase reaction control equipment; and (4) a 9.29-sq-m solar cell panel. The spacecraft stabilization is controlled by a combination flywheel and magnetic control coil system so sensors are maintained in the desired earth-looking mode. One feature is the precision-pointing accuracy of the primary imager to 0.01 deg provided by a star sensor and an updated ephemeris navigation system. This allows automatic geographical mapping of the digital imagery to the nearest picture element. The operational linescan system is the primary data acquisition system that provides real-time or stored, multi-orbit, day-and-night, visual and infrared imagery of clouds. A supplementary sensor package contains five special sensors: (1) a microwave temperature sounder, (2) an advanced X-ray detector, (3) an ionospheric/scintillation monitor, (4) a precipitating electron/ion spectrometer, and (5) a microwave imager. An infrared temperature and moisture sounder and a magnetometer may also be included on this spacecraft. Either recorded or real-time data are transmitted to ground-receiving sites by two redundant S-band transmitters. Recorded data are read out to tracking sites located at Fairchild AFB, Wash., and at Loring AFB, Maine, and relayed by SATCOM to Air Force Global Weather Central, Offutt AFB, Nebraska. Real-time data are read out at mobile tactical sites located around the world. Additional information concerning this satellite program can be found in the report by D. A. Nichols, \"The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program,\" Optical Engineering, v. 14, n. 4, p. 273, July-August, 1975.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: DMSP 5D-2/F8 \n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: DMSP (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program)\n      Short_Name: DMSP 5D-2/F8\n      Long_Name: Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-F8\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: DMSP-F8\n      Short_Name: USA 26\n      Short_Name: WX9543\n      Short_Name: 18123\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: SSJ/4\n      Short_Name: SSM/T\n      Short_Name: SSB/X\n      Short_Name: OLS\n      Short_Name: SSM/I\n      Short_Name: SSI/ES\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Inclination: 97.6\u00b0\n      Period: 96.89 minutes\n      Perigee: 564.0 km\n      Apogee: 653.0 km\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1987-053A\n   Online_Resource: http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/missions/dmsp.html\n   Online_Resource: http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/dmsp/index.html\nEnd_Group"}, "B-200": {"short_name": "B-200", "long_name": "Beechcraft King Air B-200", "description": "The Beechcraft Super King Air family is part of a line of twin-turboprop aircraft produced by the Beech Aircraft Corporation (now the Beechcraft Division of Hawker Beechcraft).

Named the Gravity and Extreme Magnetism Small Explorer (GEMS), the satellite will be the first to systematically measure the polarization of cosmic X-ray sources.\n\n\"To date, astronomers have measured X-ray polarization from only a single object outside the solar system -- the famous Crab Nebula, the luminous cloud that marks the site of an exploded star,\" said Jean Swank, a Goddard astrophysicist and the GEMS principal investigator. \u201cWe expect that GEMS will detect dozens of sources and really open up this new frontier.\"\n\nGoddard will provide the X-ray mirrors and polarimeter instrument for GEMS and oversee the mission's science operations center, science data processing and systems engineering.\n\nElectromagnetic radiation -- light, radio waves, X-rays -- contains a varying electric field. Polarization refers to this field's direction. An everyday example of putting polarization to use is as close as a pair of sunglasses. Reflected light contains an electric field with a specific orientation. Because polarized sunglasses block light vibrating in this direction, they can reduce the glare of reflected sunlight.\n\nThe extreme gravitational field near a spinning black hole not only bends the paths of X-rays, it also alters the directions of their electric fields. Polarization measurements can reveal the presence of a black hole and provide astronomers with information on its spin. Fast-moving electrons emit polarized X-rays as they spiral through intense magnetic fields, providing GEMS with the means to explore another aspect of extreme environments.\n\n\"Thanks to these effects, GEMS can probe spatial scales far smaller than any telescope can possibly image,\" Swank said. Polarized X-rays carry information about the structure of cosmic sources that isn't available in any other way.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: GEMS\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Solar/Space Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: NASA Small Explorer (SMEX)\n      Short_Name: GEMS\n      Long_Name: Gravity and Extreme Magnetism Small Explorer\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2009-08-11\n   Online_Resource: http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2009/gems_explore.html\n   Online_Resource: http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/gems/\n   Online_Resource: http://explorers.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n   Sample_Image: http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/images/content/376204main_GEMS_labeled_226.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2014-07-01\n      Design_Life: 2 years\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "CESSNA SINGLE-ENGINE AIRCRAFT": {"short_name": "CESSNA SINGLE-ENGINE AIRCRAFT"}, "Himawari": {"short_name": "Himawari", "description": "The Japanese Geostationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS) series, also known as its nickname, \"Himawari\" (meaning a \"sunflower\"), is on the geostationary orbit at 140 degrees of east longitude to carry out weather observation from space being part of the World Weather Watch (WWW) project of the World Meteorological Organization.

The two fluid physics experiments studied the dynamic behavior of rotating and oscillating liquid drops, and the convection processes found in planetary atmospheres and in stellar interiors. The performance of equipment and facilities specially designed for investigations on the Spacelab Life Sciences mission series was evaluated. The investigations selected for the Spacelab 3 mission originated in the United States, France, and India, and represented a total of five different disciplines, including material science, life sciences, fluid mechanics, atmospheric science, and astronomy. Two of the investigations, one in material science and one in astronomy, had already flown aboard Spacelab 1. Many of the Spacelab 3 investigations were scheduled to be modified and reflown on later missions to further explore the discoveries of this mission. Some of the experiments were located in the module, some on the pallet in the payload bay, and one at middeck. Spacelab 3 consisted of a Spacelab long module and a pallet.

Deliveries commenced in late 1954.\n\nThe first significant upgrade to the 310 line came with the 310C of 1959, which introduced more powerful 195kW (260hp) IO-470-D engines. The 310D of 1960 featured swept back vertical tail surfaces. An extra cabin window was added with the 310F. A development of the 310F was the turbocharged 320 Skyknight, with TSIO-470-B engines and a fourth cabin side-window. The Skyknight was in production between 1961 and 1969 (the 320D, E and F were named Executive Skyknight), when it was replaced by the similar Turbo 310.\n\nThe 310G introduced the 'stabila-tip' tip tanks, while the 310K replaced the rear two windows on each side with a single unit. Subsequent significant developments include the 310Q and turbocharged T310Q with redesigned rear cabin with a skylight window, and the final 310R and T310R, identifiable for their lengthened noses.

By measuring the time between transmission of\nthe beam and reception of the reflected signal from the\nsatellite, stations can precisely measure the distance between\nthemselves and the satellite. These distances can be used to\ncalculate station positions to within 1-3 cm. Long term data\nsets can be used to monitor the motion of the Earth's tectonic\nplates, measure the Earth's gravitational field, measure the\n\"wobble\" in the Earth's axis of rotation, and better determine\nthe length of an Earth day.\n\nLAGEOS 2 was a joint program between NASA and the Italian space\nagency (ASI), which built the satellite using LAGEOS 1 drawings\nand specifications, handling fixtures, and other materials\nprovided by NASA.\n\nLAGEOS 2's orbit was selected to provide more coverage of\n  seismically active areas, such as the Mediterranean Basin and\n  California, and may help scientists understand irregularities\n  noted in the motion of LAGEOS 1. Ground tracking stations are\n  located in many countries (including the US, Mexico, France,\n  Germany, Poland, Australia, Egypt, China, Peru, Italy, and\n  Japan) and data from these stations is available world-wide to\n  investigators studying crustal dynamics. LAGEOS 1 also\n  contains a message plaque addressed to human and other beings\n  of the far distant future with maps of the Earth from 3\n  different eras - 268 million years in the past, present day,\n  and 8 million years in the future (the satellite's estimated\n  decay date). Spacecraft: Both satellites are spherical bodies\n  with an aluminum shell wrapped around a brass core. The design\n  was a compromise between numerous factors including the need\n  to be as heavy as possible to minimise the effects of\n  non-gravitational forces vs.  being light enough to be placed\n  in a high orbit and the need to accommodate as many\n  retroreflectors as possible vs. the need to minimise surface\n  area to minimise the effects of solar pressure. The materials\n  were chosen to reduce the effects of the Earth's magnetic\n  field on the satellite's orbit.426 cube-corner retroreflectors\n  are imbedded in the satellites' surface.422 of these are made\n  of fused silica glass while the other 4 are made of\n  germanium. The vehicles have no onboard sensors or\n  electronics, and are not attitude controlled. Payload: Science\n  is performed by reflecting laser light from the vehicle's 426\n  retroreflectors.\n\n Additional characteristics:\n\n-50 years design life\n-0.6m total length\n-0.6m maximum diameter\n-405 kg total mass\n\n Additional information available at\n\"http://www.astronautix.com/craft/lageos.htm\"\n\n[Summary provided by SpaceBank.com]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: LAGEOS-2\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: LAGEOS (Laser Geodetic Satellite)\n      Short_Name: LAGEOS-2\n      Long_Name: Laser Geodetic Satellite-2\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: LAGEOS-2\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: LASER TRACKING REFLECTOR\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Inclination: 52.70 deg\n      Period: 222.50 min\n      Perigee: 5,616 km\n      Apogee: 5,952 km\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-10-10\n   Online_Resource: http://www.astronautix.com/craft/lageos.htm\n   Online_Resource: http://ilrs.gsfc.nasa.gov/satellite_missions/list_of_satellites/lag1_general.html\n   Online_Resource: http://nasascience.nasa.gov/missions/lageos-1-2\n   Sample_Image: http://msl.jpl.nasa.gov/QuickLooks/pictures/lageos.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1992-10-22\n      Launch_Site: Cape Canaveral/Kennedy Space Center, USA\n      Design_Life: 50 year\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "R/V ITALIA": {"short_name": "R/V ITALIA"}, "Aeolus": {"short_name": "Aeolus", "description": "The Earth Explorer Atmospheric Dynamics Mission Aeolus will provide global observations of wind profiles from space to improve the quality of weather forecasts, and to advance our understanding of atmospheric dynamics and climate processes.\n\nAlthough there are several ways of measuring wind from a satellite, Aeolus will utilise the active Doppler Wind Lidars (DWL) method.

GOES satellites provide the familiar weather pictures seen on United States television newscasts every day. The GOES imaging and sounding instruments (built by ITT) feature flexible scans for small-scale area viewing in regions of the visible and infrared spectrum allowing meteorologists to improve short-term forecasts. GOES provides nearly continuous imaging and sounding, which allow forecasters to better measure changes in atmospheric temperature and moisture distributions and hence increase the accuracy of their forecasts. GOES environmental information is used for a host of applications, including weather monitoring and prediction models, ocean temperatures and moisture locations, climate studies, cryosphere (ice, snow, glaciers) detection and extent, land temperatures and crop conditions, and hazards detection. The GOES-O&P Imagers have improved resolution in the 13 micrometer channel from 8 km to 4 km. The finer spatial resolution allows an improved cloud-top product, height of atmospheric motion vectors and volcanic ash detection.

Last month, NASA Glenn unveiled the modified plane in Cleveland.\n\n\"We were able to capitalize on the decommissioning by acquiring the aircraft directly from the Navy,\" explained Dr. Rickey Shyne, director of Glenn's Facilities and Test Directorate. \"This saved taxpayers millions of dollars compared to the cost of a new aircraft.\"\n\nWorkers at the Navy's Fleet Readiness Center - Southeast and a Boeing facility in Fla. enhanced the plane by adding commercial satellite communications, global positioning navigation and weather radar systems. They installed research equipment racks in what was once the plane's bomb bay. And they gave it a shiny blue-and-white NASA paint job.\n\nWith these new features, NASA's S-3B Viking is equipped to conduct science and aeronautics missions, such as environmental monitoring, satellite communications testing and aviation safety research.

The first production models were delivered in 1956 and they are still in production as of 2008; more than 43,000 have been built.[1] The Skyhawk's main competitors have been the Beechcraft Musketeer and Grumman AA-5 series (neither in production), the Piper Cherokee and, more recently, the Diamond DA40.\n\nThe Cessna 172 started life as a tricycle landing gear upgrade from the taildragger Cessna 170, with a basic level of standard equipment. The first flight of the prototype was in November 1955. The 172 became an overnight sales success and over 1400 were built in 1956, its first full year of production.\n\nEarly 172s were similar in appearance to the 170, with the same straight aft fuselage and tall gear legs, although the 172 had a straight vertical tail while the 170 had a rounded fin and rudder. Later 172 versions incorporated revised landing gear and the sweptback tail which is still in use today.The final aesthetic development in the mid-1960s, was a lowered rear deck that allowed an aft window. Cessna advertised this added rear visibility as \"Omni-Vision\" . This airframe configuration has remained almost unchanged since then, except for updates in avionics and engines, including the Garmin G1000 glass cockpit in 2005. Production had been halted in the mid-1980s, but was resumed in 1996 with the 160 hp (120 kW) Cessna 172R Skyhawk and was supplemented in 1998 by the 180 hp (135 kW) Cessna 172S Skyhawk SP.\n\n[Text and Photo provided by: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_172 ]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: CESSNA 172 SKYHAWK\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Aircraft\n      Short_Name: CESSNA 172 SKYHAWK\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-14\n   Online_Resource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_172\n   Online_Resource: http://www.cessna.com/\n   Sample_Image: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Cessna172-CatalinaTakeOff.JPG/800px-Cessna172-CatalinaTakeOff.JPG\nEnd_Group"}, "R/V OREGON": {"short_name": "R/V OREGON", "description": "The NOAA Ship Oregon II conducts fishery and living marine resource studies in support of the research of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Pascagoula Laboratory in Pascagoula, Mississippi.

It was designed and developed in a collaborative effort between the Malaysian government, under the government appointed company ATSB \\[Astronautic Technology (Malaysia) Sdn. Bdh.\\] of Kuala Lumpur, and SSTL (Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd.) of Surrey, UK. In the view of the Malaysian government, the satellite development program was seen as an impetus for expanding Malaysia's capability in the area of high-technology industry. The first satellite was named \"Tiung\" after a beautiful small singing bird in Malaysia. Astronautic Technology Sdn. Bhd. (ATSB) is a research and development organization, which was formed in 1995 by the government of Malaysia. \n\nThe TiungSat-1 specific applications are in the following fields:\n\n* Collection of imagery for environmental and meteorological use\n* Digital S&F (Store & Forward) communications\n* Technology demonstration\n* Space science\n* Amateur radio access\n\nSpacecraft:\n\nThe TiungSat-1 S/C structure comprises eleven module trays used to house the electronics for the bus and payload systems. The box-like spacecraft has a size of 690 mm x 360 mm x 360 mm; it is three-axis stabilized using a gravity-gradient boom (6 m boom with tip mass), two 3-axis magnetorquers, and a momentum wheel. Attitude is sensed by two 3-axis magnetometers and by two-axis analog sun sensors. In addition, there are UED (Underneath Earth Detector) and SOD (Sun Overhead Detector). The pointing knowledge is in roll and pitch and in yaw (3 sigma values). The S/C power is 35 W per panel, provided by four surface-mounted GaAs solar panels and by a 10-cell NiCd battery (7 Ah). The power subsystem provides regulated voltage supplies at +5V and 10V along with an unregulated supply which fluctuates between 12-14 V. Autonomous functions, safe modes and data are handled by two OBCs (On-Board Computer), OBC-186 and OBC-386. Onboard data handling via a CAN (Controller Area Network) between platform and payloads. The onboard data storage capacity is 1 Gbit. The S/C mass is 50 kg (platform = 35 kg, payload = 15 kg). The nominal design life is three years.\n\nRF communications: TiungSat uses conventional AMSAT frequencies (Malaysian Oscar-46), thereby giving amateur radio operators access to its data (imagery and communication capabilities). The microsatellite features an AX.25 protocol store-and-forward PACSAT protocol suite communications system. The uplink is in VHF-band with a data rate of 9.6 kbit/s; three receivers are used: Rx1 operates at 144.46 MHz, Rx2 and Rx3 operate at 145.86 145.925 MHz, selectable. The downlink is dual-redundant in UHF-band (435 to 438 MHz range with 437.300, 437.325, 437.350, 437.375 MHz, selectable) with data rates of 9.6, and 38.4 kbit/s (experimentally at 76.8 kit/s). An error-protected digital packet communications protocol is used. All spacecraft operations are performed at ATSB in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nTiungSat-1 was launched Sept. 26, 2000 on a Dnepr-1 vehicle along with other satellites (the other payloads were: SaudiSat-1A/-1B of SISR (Saudi Institute for Space Research), UniSat of the University of Rome, and MegSat-1 of the MegSat Space Division of \"Gruppo Meggiorin,\" Bresia, Italy) from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan.\n\nOrbit: Circular orbit, altitude = 650 km, inclination = 64, period = 97 minutes.\n\nSpacecraft operations are carried out at ATSB's Mission Control Station located at the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor. The satellite has also been used in a number of educational activities ranging from the physical sciences to the humanities.\n\nOperational status of TiungSat-1 as of 2004: The payload was fully operational well beyond its design life of three years. However, since Jan. 2004, the payload is only being operated intermittently to reduce the power consumption of the battery.\n\nSensor/experiment complement (MSEIS, MEIS, S&F, CEDEX):\n\nMSEIS (Multi-Spectral Earth Imaging System). MSEIS is a NAC (Narrow Angle Camera), a multispectral system of three cameras (green, red and near-infrared) in parallel, each with a 75 mm focal length optic and 100 mm aperture diameter. The NAC system provides a 78 m ground spatial resolution in three spectral bands: 510-590 nm, 610-690 nm and 810-890 nm (green, red, and near infrared). A two-dimensional CCD staring array detector with 1024 x 1024 pixels is used providing snapshot imagery of scene size 78 km x 78 km. Up to four contiguous images can be collected along the flight path. The data are digitized to 8 bits radiometric resolution (256 levels).\n\nMEIS (Metrological Earth Imaging System). MEIS is a single-band WAC (Wide Angle Camera) system with 6.5 mm focal length optics. It provides NIR imagery (810-890 nm) with a 900 m spatial resolution. The CCD area array detector has a size of 1024 x 1024 elements (pixels) for snapshot observations. Data are quantized to 8 bits radiometric resolution. An image has the size of 900 km x 900 km. The data is being used for meteorological applications.\n\nS&F (Digital Store & Forward Communications). The subsystem provides global, frequency-agile, communications for any form of digitized data: e-mail, voice-mail, scientific data exchange, fax, imagery, or even Internet mail for remote regions. The low cost and direct access offered by the TiungSat-1 microsatellite in orbit also makes it ideal for use by scientists, engineers and students based in institutes, universities and even schools throughout the world. - DSPE (Digital Signal Processing Experiment). The DSPE consists of a TM320C31 low power DSP suitable for special or general purpose signal processing tasks on LEO satellites. The VHF scanner operates in the 140-150 MHz range. A built-in FSK decoder is used. The system is capable to detect signals from a pre-set signal strength threshold within selected bar. DSP can be used for processing audio transmission for rebroadcast.\n\nCEDEX (Cosmic Ray Energy Deposition Experiment). The objective of CEDEX is to characterize the TiungSat-1 orbit radiation environment in terms of the observed particle LET (Linear Energy Transfer) spectrum at the spacecraft. The primary sensor consists of a 30mm x 30mm PIN diode detector 300 microns in depth, housed in a separate screened aluminium unit mounted on the CEDEX module box (three area PIN-diode detectors are mounted in a \"telescopic\" arrangement; hence, information pertaining to directions of the energy particles detected can be derived.). This is connected to a charge amplifier and a pulse-shaping circuit which, in turn, are connected to an event-driven, hardware-logic controlled pulse-height multi-channel analyzer. CEDEX is controlled autonomously by a CAN-microcontroller with its own data-storage RAM and built-in data-compression software. This sends data to an internal CAN-controller which formats and sends them on to the primary OBC via the spacecraft's CAN (Controlled Area Network) bus. CEDEX is a multichannel analyzer with 512 channels and a 0.5 pC (picocoulomb) charge resolution. The instrument charge range is between 0.2 -24 pC, equivalent to a normal incidence particle LET range of about 60 - 7500 MeV cm2 g-1 (200,000 particles/s).\n\nThe CEDEX data obtained are comparable directly with such instruments as CREDO-II flown on STRV-1c (launch Nov. 16, 2000) and CRE (Cosmic Ray Experiment) flown on KitSat-1 (launch Aug. 10, 1992) and PoSat-1 (launch Sept. 26, 1993).\n\nExperimental Microsatellite GPS, an SSTL/ESA collaboration. An advanced 12-channel GPS receiver with two GPS patch antennas is installed for several objectives: 1) onboard generation of Keplerian orbital elements (NORAD experiment, this was first performed on PoSat), 2) onboard navigation, attitude, and timing services, and 3) refractive sounding of the ionosphere. The instrument is primarily used for orbit and position determination and for precise onboard timing services. In parallel, the instrument is also employed for refractive ionospheric monitoring. The TEC (Total Electron Content) occultation observations of the instrument provide slant range measurements which can be converted into vertical profiles. \n\nInformation provided by:  http://www.eoPortal.org\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: TIUNGSAT-1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: TIUNGSAT-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: MySat-1\n      Short_Name: Oscar-46\n      Short_Name: MO-46\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: CCD IMAGER\n      Short_Name: CAMERAS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 650\n      Orbit_Inclination: 64.6\n      Period: 97.1\n      Perigee: 605.3\n      Apogee: 647\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-06-19\n   Online_Resource: http://directory.eoportal.org/get_announce.php?an_id=7470\n   Online_Resource: http://www.sstl.co.uk/\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2000-09-26\n      Launch_Site: Baikonur Cosmodrome, Tyuratam, Russia\n      Primary_Sponsor: Malaysia\n      Primary_Sponsor: Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd.

Its  objective  was  to obtain worldwide observations of total  electron  content  between  the  spacecraft and the earth.  The satellite was initially spin-stabilized, but it was despun after solar paddle erection.  Subsequent stabilization oriented the satellite axis of  symmetry  with  the  local magnetic field by means of a strong bar magnet  and  damping  rods.  A three-axis magnetometer and sun sensors provided  information  on the satellite attitude and spin rate.

Continuous transmitters also  operated  at  162  and  324  MHz  to  permit precise tracking by 'Transit'  tracking  stations for navigation and geodetic studies.  In August  1968,  data  acquisition from the satellite telemetry channels was  discontinued.   In  July  1969, tracking and world map production were  discontinued  by  GSFC,  and world map production based on NORAD orbit elements was subsequently assumed by ESRO.

This program, previously known as DAAP (Data Acquisition and Processing Program), was classified until March 1973. The objectives of this program were to provide global visual and infrared cloud cover data and specialized environmental data to support Department of Defense requirements. Operationally, the program consisted of two satellites in planned 83-km sun-synchronous polar orbits, with the ascending node of one satellite in early morning and the other at local noon. The 5.4-m-long spacecraft was separated into four sections: (1) a precision mounting platform (PMP) for sensors and equipment requiring precise alignment, (2) an equipment support module (ESM) containing the electronics, reaction wheels, and some meteorological sensors, (3) a reaction control equipment (RCE) support structure (that has the third-stage motor, hydrazine reaction control system) which supports (4) a 9.29 sq m solar cell panel. The Block 5D spacecraft stabilization was controlled by a conbination flywheel and magnetic control coil system so sensors could be maintained in the desired 'earth-looking' mode. One feature of Block 5D was the precision-pointing accuracy of the primary imager to 0.01 deg provided by a star sensor and an updated ephemeris navigation system. This allowed automatic geographical mapping of the digital imagery to the nearest picture element. The operational line scan system (OLS) built by Westinghouse, was the primary acquisition system that provided real-time or stored, multi-orbit, day-and-night visual and infrared imagery at 1/3 nautical mile resolution for all major land masses, 1-1/2 nautical mile resolution for complete global coverage, and provided with this data calibration, timing, and other auxiliary signals to the spacecraft for digital transmission to the ground. A supplementary sensor package, the special sensor H (SSH), a step-scanning radiometer, was the infrared temperature-humidity-ozone sounder. The data processing system, which included three high-density tape recorders, could store a total of 400 min of data, each allowing full global coverage twice daily. Either recorded or real-time data were transmitted to ground-receiving sites via two redundant s-band transmitters. Recorded data were read out to tracking sites located at Fairchild AFB, WA, and Loring AFB, ME, and relayed via SATCOM to Air Force Global Weather Central, Offutt AFB, NE. Real-time data were read out at mobile tactical sites located around the world. A more complete description of the Block 5D satellite can be found in the report, 'The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program,' D. A.

Each panel measured over 4.2 m in length when unfolded and\nwas covered with 3420 solar cells, each measuring 2 by 2 cm. The\nattitude control system maintained desired spacecraft orientation\nthrough gyroscopic principles incorporated into the satellite\ndesign. Earth orientation of the satellite body was maintained by\ntaking advantage of the precession induced from a momentum flywheel so\nthat the satellite body precession rate of one revolution per orbit\nprovided the desired 'earth looking' attitude. Minor adjustments in\nattitude and orientation were made by means of magnetic coils and by\nvarying the speed of the momentum flywheel.\nThis spacecraft carried four cameras; two television cameras for\nAutomatic Picture Transmission (APT), and two Advanced Vidicon Camera\nSystem (AVCS) cameras.  The satellite also carried a low-resolution\nflat plate radiometer, a solar proton monitor, and two scanning\nradiometers that not only measured emitted IR radiation but also\nserved as a backup system for the onboard cameras.  Launched into a\nnear-polar orbit, the spacecraft and its subsystems performed normally\nuntil May 29, 1971 when the incremental tape recorder failed,\nresulting in partial loss of solar proton data and total loss of flat\nplate radiometer data.

The series, originally planned to acquire data throughout the Sun's 11-year active cycle, investigated how Earth's atmosphere and climate are affected by the Sun, and by the products of industrial complexes and agricultural activities.  ATLAS 1, the first spacecraft in this series conducted 14 investigations in atmospheric science, solar physics, space plasma physics, and astrophysics.\n\nThe 14 ATLAS 1 experiments included:\n(1) Atmospheric Lyman-Alpha Emissions (ALAE)\n(2) Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS)\n(3) Grille Spectrometer (GRILLE)\n(4) Imaging Spectrometric Observatory (ISO)\n(5) Millimeter-wave Atmospheric Sounder (MAS)\n(6) Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Spectrometer (SSBUV-4) -\ntechnically, this instrument was seperate from the ATLAS payload and\nwas a co-manifested payload\n(7) Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM)\n(8) Solar Spectrum Measurement (SOLSPEC)\n(9) Solar Ultraviolet Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SUSIM)\n(10) Measurement of the Solar Constant (SOLCON)\n(11) Atmospheric Emissions Photometric Imaging (AEPI)\n(12) Space Experiments with Particle Accelerators (SEPAC)\n(13) Energetic Neutral Atom Precipitation (ENAP).

The instruments were mounted on two Spacelab pallets in the Shuttle payload bay.  The Shuttle's changing orientation to Earth placed the experiments in advantageous orbiting locations, to observe the atmosphere, the Sun, and astronomical targets.  Specifically, the orbiter orientation was either inertially fixed so that selected instruments were pointed at the sun, or nadir pointed for observations of the Earth's atmosphere. Crew members were in consultation with the investigators while controlling and monitoring the experiments. The atmospheric and solar instruments provided correlative measurements with the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: ATLAS\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Space Stations/Manned Spacecraft\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: SPACE SHUTTLE\n      Short_Name: ATLAS\n      Long_Name: Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: ATLAS\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-01-24\n   Online_Resource: http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/factsheet/Atlas-1_factsheet_prt.htm\n   Sample_Image: http://www.ghcc.msfc.nasa.gov/images/atlas/atlaslogo.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group"}, "NIMBUS": {"short_name": "NIMBUS"}, "King Air": {"short_name": "King Air", "long_name": "Beechcraft King Air", "description": "The Beechcraft King Air family is part of a line of twin-turboprop aircraft produced by the Beech Aircraft Corporation (now Beechcraft Division of Hawker Beechcraft).

The TSRC (Tsinghua Space Research Center) was set up in Oct. 1998 with the goal to integrate all space research activities at Tsinghua University and to provide a means and facilities for S/C building. The joint-venture company in Beijing is referred to as T-SSSC (Tsinghua-Surrey Small Satellite Company). The cooperative program is to develop and build microsatellites (Tsinghua-1) and nanosatellites (THNS-1) and to provide integrated training in small satellite design.\n\nTsinghua-1 (also referred to as \"Hangtian\" in Chinese) is a demonstrator microsatellite in the 50 kg class of size: 35 cm x 35 cm x 64 cm. The overall objective is to provide daily high-resolution imaging for disaster monitoring and mitigation on a worldwide scale. A further goal of Tsinghua-1 is to conduct communications research in LEO. The design uses the new MicroSat-70 platform modules or trays to carry the subsystems and payload. The power subsystem design includes the regulation, protection and distribution of a 35 W solar array and 7 Ah NiCd batteries. This subsystem essentially offers two buses: an unregulated 14 V bus and a regulated 5 V bus. The three payload modules include the GPS receiver (SGR-10 with 12 channels), transputer, and DSP/DTE (Digital Signal Processing/Data Transfer Experiment) unit. The three cameras and 3 reaction wheels are accommodated in the Earth Observation Compartment. Two GPS antennas are accommodated on the space facing side of the S/C.\n\nThe spacecraft is three-axis stabilized using a combination of passive (gravity-gradient boom) and active (magnetorquers, reaction wheels) actuator elements. The platform is nadir pointing. Attitude is sensed by sun sensors and a magnetometer. The body-pointing platform has the capability to perform fast slew maneuvers within 15 about the roll axis (or 180 about the yaw axis). An off-nadir pointing configuration can be sustained for up to half an orbit. Onboard data handling is provided with a dual CAN (Controller Area Network) bus (ISO 11898 & ISO 11519-1) 20 Mbit/s, and INMOS serial point-to-point link 9.6 kbit/s asynchronous duplex UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter).\n\nA launch of Tsinghua-1, along with SNAP-1 of SSTL as secondary payloads to Nadezhda-6, the prime Russian S&RSAT (Search & Rescue Satellite) of COSPAS, took place on June 28, 2000 on a Russian Cosmos-3M launcher from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia.\n\nOrbit: Sun-synchronous circular orbit, altitude = 700 km, inclination = 98, period of 100 minutes.\n\nStatus of Tsinghua-1 mission: The spacecraft is operational as of 2004. \n\nSensor complement:\n\nMEIS (Multispectral Earth Imaging System).MEIS is a demonstrator instrument intended for the upcoming DMC (Disaster Monitoring Constellation) mission. The objective is to acquire multispectral Earth surface imagery with a spatial resolution of 40 m (snapshot imagery). The MEIS camera assembly consists of three cameras (one for each spectral band) mounted at an angle of 15 from nadir so that the yaw angle can be selected to offer the required off-pointing angle of 15 from nadir. The image swath width is 80 km and each camera can collect four images contiguously along the flight path. The instrument performs autonomous onboard histogram analysis to ensure optimum image quality involving image processing, compression and onboard storage. The OBCs may also be used to carry out autonomous onboard cloud editing and high-compression thumb-nail image previews.\n\nSGR-10 (Space GPS Receiver-10). The objective is real-time positioning for tracking the satellite and providing orbital elements for the spacecraft mission and ground station. SGR is a customized COTS-developed receiver. The instrument is based on the second generation GPS chip set of MITEL Semiconductors. The SGR consists of the following elements: GPS antennas, LNAs, the RF section, the digital section and the TLM/TC node. \n\nRF section: The SGR has two separate RF front-ends in the RF section which are responsible for down-converting the GPS signals and digitizing the IF signals. The RF sections use the same local oscillator so that the measurements are referenced to the same fundamental TCXO clock.\n\nDigital section: This part consists of hardware correlator channels, memory, a 32 bit RISC microprocessor with supporting peripherals and the interface circuitry. There are 24 C/A code correlation channels available, although only 12 channels are available if only 2 antennas are used.\n\nTLM/TC node: A separate 8 bit microcontroller is used to provide telemetry and telecommands. The telemetry includes status monitoring of SGR, while telecommand include reset, power down parts of the receiver, some redundancy switching etc.\n\nThe SGR-10 receives the L1 signal from the GPS constellation. The total SGR mass is 1.355 kg, including antenna/LNA. The accuracy of positioning, velocity and time synchronization (under Selective Availability on GPS) are: 150 m, 1 m/s, 3-D, 2 sigma approximately, and + 1 s, respectively. \n\nInformation from http://www.eoPortal.org\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: TSINGHUA-1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: TSINGHUA-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: CAMERAS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 700\n      Orbit_Inclination: 98.14\n      Period: 98.68\n      Perigee: 687\n      Apogee: 713\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-06-19\n   Online_Resource: http://directory.eoportal.org/get_announce.php?an_id=9264\n   Online_Resource: http://www.sstl.co.uk/\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2000-06-28\n      Launch_Site: Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia\n      Primary_Sponsor: Tsinghua University (China)\n      Primary_Sponsor: Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd.

These\n observations provide grid points of observations over the\n tropical oceans which are generally devoid of weather\n observations.  Aberson and Franklin (1999) state that \"accurate\n modeling of tropical cyclone motion and intensity requires both\n realistic numerical models and accurate representation of\n meteorological fields through the depth of the troposphere on a\n variety of scales.\"  While models have greatly improved over\n the past 20 years, significant forecast improvements are still\n possible by decreasing the analysis error.

This is wh!  y NOAA has procured a new generation of\n dropwindsondes based on the Global Positioning System (GPS) as\n well a Gulfstream-IV jet aircraft (G-IV).  A study of the\n impact of the new dropwindsondes' observations on hurricane\n forecast models was conducted by Aberson and Frankilin in 1997.\n\n In the 1997 study about 30 dropwindsondes were used during each\n mission.

Further information about the data\n assimilation can be found in Aberson and Franklin (1999).\n\n For the study NCEP's GSM is run and is used as the boundary\n conditions for the HRD's barotropic model (VICBAR) and the GFDL\n model.  The track forecasts of the GSM, VICBAR, and GFDL models\n were compared to the CLIPER model to calculate track errors and\n the SHIFOR model to calculate intensity errors.

The main\nbody of the spacecraft was attitude controlled by means of horizon scanners and\ngas jets so that its orientation was maintained constant with respect to the\nearth and the sun. The solar panels rotated on a horizontal axis extending\ntransversely through the main body of the spacecraft. The rotation of the\npanels was activated by sun sensors so that the panels received maximum\nsunlight. Seven experiments were mounted on the solar panels (the SOEP\npackage). An additional axis, oriented vertically across the front of the main\nbody, carried seven experiments (the OPEP package). Nominally, these sensors\nobserved in a forward direction in the orbital plane of the satellite. The\nsensors could be rotated more than 90 deg relative to the nominal observing\nposition and more than 90 deg between the upper and lower OPEP groups mounted\non either end of this axis. On June 22, 1969, the spacecraft potential dropped\nsignificantly during sunlight operation and remained so during subsequent\nsunlight operation. This unexplained shift affected seven experiments which\nmade measurements dependent upon knowledge of the spacecraft plasma sheath.\nDuring October 1969, a string of solar cells failed, but the only effect of the\ndecreased power was to cause two experiments to change their mode of operation.\nAlso during October 1969, a combination of manual and automatic attitude\ncontrol was initiated, which extended the control gas lifetime of the attitude\ncontrol system. In August 1970, tape recorder (TR) no. 1 operation degraded, so\nall recorded data were subsequently taken with TR no. 2. By September 1970,\npower and equipment degradation left 14 experiments operating normally, 3\npartially, and 9 off. From October 14, 1970, TR no. 2 was used only on\nWednesdays (world days) to conserve power and extend TR operation. In June\n1971, the number of 'on' experiments decreased from 13 to 7, and on June 28,\n1971, the spacecraft was placed in a spin-stabilized mode about the yaw (Z)\naxis and turned off due to difficulties with spacecraft power.

The solar paddles\nand the control system housing were connected to the sensory ring by a truss\nstructure, giving the satellite the appearance of an ocean buoy. Nimbus-1 was\nnearly 3.7 m tall, 1.5 m in diameter at the base, and about 3 m across with\nsolar paddles extended. The sensory ring, which formed the satellite base,\nhoused the electronics equipment and battery modules. The lower surface of the\ntorus-shaped sensory ring provided mounting space for sensors and telemetry\nantennas. An H-frame structure mounted within the center of the torus provided\nsupport for the larger experiments and tape recorders. Mounted on the control\nsystem housing, which was located on top of the spacecraft, were sun sensors,\nhorizon scanners, gas nozzles for attitude control, and a command antenna. Use\nof a stabilization and control system allowed the spacecraft's orientation to\nbe controlled to within plus or minus 1 degree for all three axes (pitch, roll,\nand yaw).\nThe spacecraft carried an advanced vidicon camera system for recording and\nstoring remote cloudcover pictures, an automatic picture transmission camera\nfor providing real-time cloudcover pictures, and a high-resolution infrared\nradiometer to complement the daytime TV coverage and to measure nighttime\nradiative temperatures of cloud tops and surface terrain.
